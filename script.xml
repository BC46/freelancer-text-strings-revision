Fixes many typos, grammar mistakes, inconsistencies, and more, in the English text strings from the game Freelancer (2003).
This addon was made based on Jason's Freelancer Patch which already addressed a few of these issues.

Changelog:
* Made sentences more concise for better readability
* Fixed typos for misspelled words like 'Niboium', 'Aschroft', and 'excerise'
* Correctly spelled several names in the game, like 'Curaçao', 'Tenerife', and 'Rügen'
* Applied general grammar fixes
* Replaced words that didn't fit the context properly
* Consistent use of American English
* Consistent and correct use of punctuation and other symbols
* Used more consistent choices for words and names like 'Zone 21' and 'Eighty Years’ War'
* Replaced incorrect information with correct information
* Replaced several real-life names with more common ones

General informal word choices and intentional typos in rumors remain unchanged.
