Fixes many typos, grammar mistakes, inconsistencies, and more, in the English text strings from the game Freelancer (2003).
This addon was made based on Jason's Freelancer Patch which already addressed a few of these issues.

Changelog:
~1,850 lines changed.
* Made wordy sentences more concise for better readability
* Fixed typos for misspelled words like 'Niboium', 'Aschroft', and 'excerise'
* Correctly spelled several names in the game, like 'Curacao', 'Tenerife', and 'Rugen'
* Applied general grammar fixes
* Replaced words that didn't fit the context properly
* Consistent use of American English
* Consistent and correct use of punctuation and other symbols
* Used more consistent choices for words and names like 'Zone 21' and 'Eighty Yearsâ€™ War'
* Replaced incorrect information with correct information
* Replaced several uncommon/nonexistent real-life names with more common ones
* Readded spaces to mission alert messages
* Improved name localization
* Corrected option setting descriptions

General informal word choices and intentional typos in rumors remain unchanged.
