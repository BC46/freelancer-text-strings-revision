# freelancer-text-strings-revision
Fixes many typos, grammar mistakes, and misspelled words in the English text strings from the game Freelancer (2003). This modification was built based on several files from Jason's Freelancer Patch.

## Changes
This repository includes 7 DLL files which contain the strings that are used in the game. Additionally, you'll find a text file named `export.txt`, which is an export of all the strings from the DLLs. To find out what exactly has been changed, please check the commit history for the `export.txt` file.
