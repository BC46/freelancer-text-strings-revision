*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI met Lonnigan as planned on Kurile yesterday and we came to an agreement on the price. The plan is to meet on Freeport 7 tomorrow to seal the deal on the ore shipment. If everything works out, they’ll owe me a million credits. It’s the deal of a lifetime.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I did the deal. I’m now the proud owner of over a ton of Boron. I put all my savings into this deal. It’s not entirely legal, but here in the Border Worlds, nobody really pays too much attention to this. I’ve been in contact with a man named Lonnigan. Apparently, he’s a hired gun representing Samura Heavy Industries. He says his clients might be interested in the shipment.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s been six weeks since my last entry. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find out anything about alien ruins or uncharted systems. Very frustrating. The only thing I’ve heard was that there’ve been sightings of strange ships out near Sigma-17. Who knows? The good news is that I’ve managed to hook up with a captain of a Republican Shipping convoy. He’s transporting a large shipment of Boron from Mainz to Honshu but wants to keep the profits for himself. We agreed to meet on Kurile tomorrow. We’ll see, maybe luck is on my side this time.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter two weeks of travel, I finally managed to get to the Sigma system cluster. The trip through the Independent Worlds turned out to be much more dangerous than I thought. I was lucky several times that police patrols happened to be in the area when pirates wanted to blast me out of the stars. Anyway, word has it that there are several uncharted systems in this area of space. I will try to find out more information.\n\nPERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’ve finally decided to leave Bretonia and to try my luck in the Border Worlds. Despite what Tobias says, I can’t sit around Leeds for the rest of my life and fix up other people’s ships while more and more alien ruins are being discovered. They say that only 11 percent of the Border Worlds have been charted yet and hundreds of unknown planets are awaiting discovery. I’m starting this personal Neural Net Log to keep track of my travels and adventures.

NAME
A formerly hypothetical structure first described in 1959 A.D. by the physicist Freeman Dyson in a short paper entitled “Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation”, a Dyson sphere is an artificial hollow sphere of matter around a star designed to capture nearly all of the star’s radiated energy for industrial use. The original proposal by Dyson did not go into much detail about how a Dyson sphere would be constructed, focusing instead on the more fundamental issue of how an advanced civilization could expand its energy production to the maximum possible for a given solar system. Such a civilization would be classified as a Phase II civilization under the classification scheme developed by Nikolai Kardashev.

Just moments ago, the survivors of the Freeport 7 disaster arrived here in Manhattan. After two days of intense travel, several of the survivors required immediate medical attention. Requests by the LSF to conduct interviews concerning the attack have been declined by the medical commissioner. Meanwhile, the official death toll has risen to 2,600, making it the most devastating disaster in recent history.

Rheinland Admiral Otto Schultzky arrives in Manhattan today to meet with President Jacobi. Though they plan to discuss a new trade proposal, the President says that a heightened cooperative security measure will be on their agenda as well in light of the recent Freeport 7 tragedy. The admiral’s flagship, the RNC Donau, will arrive in Manhattan today under heavy guard.

Jacobi and Schultzky have met on several occasions before his formal diplomatic appointment, and she has previously described him as “a man of reason, committed to peace.”

Freeport 7 Public Reaction

15008
NAME
Citizens everywhere are still in shock at the news of Freeport 7’s destruction. The station, operated by the Zoners, served as a neutral trading facility for all walks of life from around the galaxy. In the face of the catastrophic loss of life and the growing consensus that this was most likely a deliberate attack, people are struggling to grasp the motive behind this senseless act of violence.

15009
NAME
Market Holds Trades

15010
NAME
In Manhattan, the center of galactic trade, all orders were held for one minute in honor of those lost on Freeport 7. The market remains more sluggish than usual at this time. However, analysts expect a full recovery.

NAME
Liberty Mediates BW Talks

15012
NAME
Negotiations slowed to a crawl yesterday as delegates from Kusari and Rheinland heatedly debated acquisitions in the Border Worlds. Kusari had proposed a “full disclosure” initiative, which was protested and then effectively blocked by Rheinland. Recent territorial disputes in the Border Worlds, largely driven by the discovery of a wealth of new resources and Artifacts, have sparked these talks between the colonies, with Liberty acting as mediator. However, with the delegates now polarized over this issue, it is unclear how effective these talks will be.

15013
NAME
Military to Investigate FP7

15014
NAME
Government sources say that because of The Order’s potential involvement, President Jacobi has put the investigation of Freeport 7 into the hands of a special unit within the Liberty Military. This corps of investigators will be charged with securing the wreckage, gathering evidence, and coordinating with forensic teams in the solemn task of recovering and identifying human remains.

15015
NAME
Doctors Hold Off LSF Inquiry

15016
NAME
A group of Freeport 7 survivors, many of whom were critically injured, were taken to the Williams-Creek Medical Center for treatment. There they were triaged, and some underwent emergency, life-saving procedures. Agents of the LSF were also on hand to question those who could talk, but doctors insisted that they be allowed to recover before being subjected to the added stress. The LSF acquiesced but insisted that these patients be kept in a secure location within the medical center. Doctors have set aside Ward 13 for their convalescence.

15017
NAME
Schultzky Killed in Manhattan

15018
NAME
Rheinland Admiral Otto Schultzky has been assassinated by members of The Order! The President was visibly shaken when she heard that the ship carrying the Admiral was totally destroyed on its final approach to Newark Station. After extending her condolences to Rheinland, she ordered a full inquest, immediately charging the LSF to pursue The Order as its number one priority.

15019
NAME
Reaction to FP7 Investigation

15020
NAME
Other voices in Sirius have begun to question Liberty’s move to place military forces in what has always been an apolitical, neutral zone. Some have said that this investigation should be an open, pan-colonial undertaking and that the stationing of military forces in Sigma-17 violates charter settlement agreements between the Houses and other factions. To assuage these concerns, President Jacobi spoke, insisting that the recent movement of The Order required immediate action. She also stated that our forces were there to prevent further contamination of the area and to execute a thorough investigation — nothing more. Jacobi went on to stress that our formal presence at the Freeport 7 site would be exclusive and temporary, and that the sum of the findings would be shared with all affected government agencies.

15021
NAME
New York Crime Wave on the Rise?

15022
NAME
Are we at greater risk at home now more than ever? That’s the question. When The Order penetrated our defenses to kill Otto Schultzky nearly on the very steps of the presidential palace, many of our illusions about our own security were affected. Add to this the destruction of Freeport 7 and the sharp increase of attacks by the Liberty Rogues in New York, and we begin to feel anxiety and uneasiness about our personal and economic security. The President and the LSF say that they are addressing these concerns, but without concrete results, we are still left asking the questions, “Are these events related? And what can we do about The Order?”

15023
NAME
Niemann Blames Liberty for Death

15024
NAME
Chancellor Niemann of Rheinland spoke out bitterly today, citing lax security and blaming Liberty for the recent death of Admiral Schultzky during his visit. Niemann went on to say that he would personally punish those responsible, regardless of where they hide.

15025
NAME
FP7 Survivors to Talk

15026
NAME
Manhattan — Doctors at the WCMC have given the go-ahead for special LSF investigators to interview many of the Freeport 7 survivors. Despite an earlier recommendation against this course of action, we are told that government pressures have motivated physicians to allow at least a conditional line of questioning of select patients. It is hoped that their eyewitness testimony will help to shed some light on who truly is responsible.

15027
NAME
Local Crime Ring Smashed

15028
NAME
Seemingly in answer to growing security concerns, LSF forces took action and delivered a crushing blow to Liberty Rogues operating secretly near Pittsburgh. Following up on details from an ongoing investigation, the well-hidden base was rooted out and surgically eliminated by agents who acted under tactical LSF authority. Aemon Bonnerille of the LSF promises that this is just the beginning, as he intends to “tighten the noose around the neck of organized crime.”

15029
NAME
Local Prison Ship Rescued

15030
NAME
Just before LSF fighters closed in on a secret Rogue base near Pittsburgh, they were instrumental in fighting off a coordinated attack on a local prison ship. Prison Ship XT-19 is generally used as a staging area for prisoners being shuttled between processing stations and more permanent lockdowns in Texas. It was during such a transfer that the Rogues suddenly attacked and overran its defenses. Authorities believe that the Rogues were attempting to liberate a group of its own members being interrogated on board. Fortunately, however, the LSF arrived just in time to repel the pirates and avert disaster. Though XT-19 sustained heavy damage, we are told that the ship was successfully towed to Baltimore Shipyard for repairs.

15031
NAME
Liberty Imposes Artifact Ban

15032
NAME
President Jacobi announced today that, based on the appearance of new, unstudied, and potentially dangerous classes of Artifacts in Liberty, she is temporarily suspending all Artifact trading, pending further investigation. Despite initial protests, she has assured trade union reps that they will be adequately compensated and that, once evaluated, regulated trading will resume. Authorities have asked all citizens to comply with this temporary precaution until more can be learned.

15033
NAME
Big Guns Stand Vigil at Our Gates

15034
NAME
Responding to the public outcry on security issues, the government has now placed battleships at all Jump Gates on Liberty’s borders. Though some citizens are comforted by Liberty’s actions for better protection from both foreign attack and domestic smuggling and crime, others are concerned over the freedoms we might be sacrificing as we resort to potentially harsher military involvement to maintain security.

15035
NAME
Trouble in Zone 21?

15036
NAME
Civilian listening posts reported an unusual disturbance coming from Zone 21. Despite its exaggerated reputation among conspiracy buffs as an area for so-called “secret research,” navy officials say that Zone 21 is only used for legitimate weapons testing and strategic training. They had no comment at this time about the disturbance.

15037
NAME
Evidence Pointing to The Order

15038
NAME
The LSF today has said that between the material retrieved from the Freeport 7 site and the weight of survivor testimony, there is sufficient evidence to support allegations that The Order did in fact participate in the Freeport 7 attack. Though officials have yet to ascribe a motive to The Order’s actions, or the exact weapons used, this new evidence has caused them to narrow their focus to establish an “operative presence” onboard the station before its destruction. They are now 100 percent confident that at least one Order member was on Freeport 7 hours before it was destroyed.

15039
NAME
Some FP7 Survivors Dead, Missing

15040
NAME
Doctors at the Williams-Creek Medical Center have reported several deaths in Ward 13, the sealed treatment facility for the survivors of Freeport 7. “These deaths are regrettable,” they say, but not surprising due to their extensive injuries. However, we’ve also learned that at least one patient appears to be unaccounted for at this time. Though doctors and LSF officials refused to comment, we understand that hospital security is looking into the matter.

15041
NAME
FP7 Manifest Sought

15042
NAME
As investigators search the Freeport 7 wreckage for clues, the one missing piece of the puzzle appears to be the station’s manifest. Once the manifest has been found and analyzed, authorities believe they will be able to accurately depict the final hours of the station right down to who was present on it, what ships were docked, and perhaps even how it might have been destroyed.

15043
NAME
Explosion in Zone 21 Was Attack

15044
NAME
After avoiding questions earlier, the Liberty Military has confirmed the sabotage of a Liberty cruiser in Zone 21. They also said that a coded transmission coming from within the cruiser just before its destruction was intercepted and deciphered. Based on the contents of the message, military authorities suspect operatives working for The Order. However, they do not know yet how saboteurs could have penetrated security to board the ship. The antimatter bomb that was detonated inside created a blast zone large enough to consume three cruisers and damage several nearby ships. There were no survivors in the suicide bombing, and the names of the ships and crewmen are being withheld at this time.

15045
NAME
Orillion Named as Order leader

15046
NAME
Today the President announced two contributions that advanced the exposure of The Order’s leadership infrastructure: evidence provided by the LSF, and the decoded transmission from Zone 21. Jacobi says that there are repeated references to a single individual known only as “Orillion.” LSF analysts believe this to be a codename. The President says that now it is only a matter of time before The Order will be rooted out and brought to justice.

15047
NAME
Pueblo Station Nearly Destroyed

15048
NAME
Reports have come in that Pueblo Station was viciously attacked by a well-organized band of smugglers under the direction of the notorious Sean Ashcroft. Even though rescue vehicles, medics, and LSF reinforcements arrived at the scene, damage to the station was nearly total, and Pueblo suffered many casualties. Ashcroft, a known Artifact smuggler, was subsequently apprehended by LSF agents and is being held in an unnamed LSF facility for questioning.

15049
NAME
LSF Tightens Criminal Noose

15050
NAME
LSF Director Aemon Bonnerille announced that his organization is continuing to tighten its grasp on piracy, smuggling, and all other illegal activities. Though some minor detractors claim that the methods being used are a violation of rights, others are relieved that the government is finally taking a more active role in domestic security.

15051
NAME
Kusari – Rheinland Anxiety Grows

15052
NAME
Despite repeated attempts by the President to smooth relations, Chancellor Niemann of Rheinland continues to insist that Kusari is guilty of theft, espionage, and now even conspiracy with The Order. Kusari has flatly denied these allegations, calling the Chancellor’s actions “slanderous,” and accusing Rheinland of taking armed action against Kusari ships in the Border Worlds.

15053
NAME
Rheinland Station Attacked

15054
NAME
More trouble in Rheinland — this time in the Hamburg system. Sources there report that a scientific research station was looted by marauders and left severely damaged. Investigators deny speculation that The Order might be involved, saying that evidence points instead to a small group of pirates allegedly backed by Kusari interests.

15055
NAME
Is Orillion Operating in Liberty?

15056
NAME
Sources say that there may be a relationship between organized crime and the movements of The Order. Moreover, there is a remote possibility that its leader, Orillion, may be operating within the confines of Liberty under criminal “protection.” Though the LSF has officially downplayed this idea, they say that they are following up on every legitimate lead to exposing Orillion, The Order, and whatever ties they may have.

15057
NAME
Rogue Attack on Ft. Bush

15058
NAME
Reports of an unprovoked Rogue attack on Ft. Bush surfaced today. Witnesses say that the Liberty Rogues suddenly appeared and began to attack several ships and the large station. This kind of attack is historically very unusual for them, say analysts, but consistent with recent Rogue behavior. Though the pirates were repelled and there was only minor damage reported by the station, this does raise some concern for the ongoing security issues in Liberty right now.

15059
NAME
Radicals Commit Suicide

15060
NAME
The Liberty Military reports that several subversives and radical sympathizers of The Order have recently committed suicide rather than face arrest. Although the names of these suspects are being withheld at this time, authorities say that they are still part of an ongoing investigation.

15061
NAME
LSF Conducts Internal Meetings

15062
NAME
With Liberty’s security in the balance, Aemon Bonnerille said that the LSF was developing a new internal plan for dealing with security issues. Though he declined to share the details of his new initiative, he has scheduled meetings with all key LSF control personnel.

15063
NAME
Kusari, Rheinland Square Off

15064
NAME
Shogun Edo of Kusari is said to have taken great umbrage towards recent remarks made by Chancellor Niemann. Edo bitterly dismissed the accusations of conspiracy and espionage, accusing the Chancellor of clouding the issues of his illegal operations in the Border Worlds and his infringement of the Boorman Treaty, which forbids armed aggression between the major Houses.

15065
NAME
Orillion Death Yields Few Answers

15066
NAME
Aemon Bonnerille, Director of the LSF, said, “I hope that with the death of Orillion, information about The Order’s operations in Liberty and elsewhere will be quickly discovered.” However, with more questions than answers right now, some people feel that the only man who could have shed light on Freeport 7 and other criminal acts was silenced by the LSF.

15067
NAME
Rheinland Foreign Minister Dead

15068
NAME
Karl Ettinger, Foreign Minister of Rheinland, was reportedly killed in a bomb blast earlier today. Ettinger was en route to inspect the remains of the Hamburg Station when a fusion bomb, apparently hidden in one of his attending ships, detonated, killing everyone. Rheinland authorities say they are investigating the site of the incident, but since the destruction was so utterly complete, they have little to go on at this time.

15069
NAME
Rheinland Ships in Liberty?

15070
NAME
Rheinland Military ships allegedly entered Liberty space today and opened fire without warning. The President immediately contacted Chancellor Niemann, who denied that there were any official military units in the area. Military officials had no immediate comment but said that the incident is under investigation.

15071
NAME
Rheinland Allegations

15072
NAME
Chancellor Niemann is said to have spoken directly with both President Jacobi and Queen Carina of Bretonia about the allegations he has raised against Kusari. Niemann has accused Kusari of backing The Order in its attacks against Rheinland and Liberty, and has now added the assassination of Karl Ettinger to his list of charges.

15073
NAME
Freeport 7 Manifest Found!

15074
NAME
The Freeport 7 data manifest has been found, according to the LSF. Agents finally discovered the sought-after module in a palette of wreckage reportedly salvaged by the Junkers. The data manifest, we are told, was acquired and immediately taken to the LSF labs for analysis. Based on the extracted data, investigators are certain that Orillion was indeed on Freeport 7 just before its destruction.

15075
NAME
Rheinland Fortifies KU Border

15076
NAME
There is what can only be described as a Rheinland Military buildup on their side of the shared border with Kusari. Chancellor Niemann says he will defend Rheinland against any more Kusari-based incursions even if it means taking matters into his own hands. Kusari, denying any wrongdoing, has deployed ships as well and adopted a defensive stance of its own in response to this action.

15077
NAME
Liberty, Bretonia Propose Summit

15078
NAME
Recent action on the Rheinland/Kusari border has caused other colonies great concern. In answer to this, President Jacobi and Lord Quigley of Bretonia have jointly proposed an emergency summit meeting to bring about a peaceful settlement. Lord Quigley, who has had a long career in successful diplomatic negotiations, is said to be acting under the direct wishes of his cousin, Queen Carina. There is no word yet on the Chancellor’s response to this proposal.

15079
NAME
Manifest Exposes Orillion

15080
NAME
Based on its most current evidence and testimony, the LSF believes that Orillion, a.k.a. Sam Lonnigan, came to Freeport 7 to steal several large shipments of unusually expensive goods and Artifacts that were in its bays. Once his agents took control of the shipments and presumably eliminated their rightful owners, it is believed that he ordered the ships to take off and destroy the station to cover their tracks. Lonnigan was likely to have been the last to leave. However, for whatever reason, he was caught in his own trap and was injured in the blast. Lonnigan was brought to Liberty by rescue ship and was admitted to the WCMC. Local Order operatives liberated him from Ward 13, and after his quick recovery, they implemented a wave of terror using Manhattan as a new base of operations. The LSF now says that it has all it needs to identify Lonnigan’s accomplices, who may still be at large.

15081
NAME
Boorman Treaty Violated?

15082
NAME
Shogun Edo now insists that Rheinland’s continued military actions show them to be in complete violation of the Boorman Treaty. Edo’s tone was almost accusatory in itself, as he asked why Liberty refused to help the Kusari people. The President, in fact, did speak to both powers today, asking them to reduce the buildup at their borders and to present their respective issues at the proposed summit meeting.

15083
NAME
Curaçao Summit is Now Set

15084
NAME
With Rheinland finally agreeing to attend, the summit meeting is now moving forward. Delegates, including our own Secretary Ballenshine representing Liberty, are to attend the meeting on Curaçao sometime in the coming week.

15085
NAME
Ballenshine Pronounced Dead

15086
NAME
Liberty Secretary James Ballenshine collapsed today and was evacuated to a government medical unit, where he was pronounced dead of natural causes. President Jacobi said that his sudden passing will not diminish Liberty’s commitment to peace and stability in the colonies. She will now be attending the summit meeting on Curaçao in his place.

15087
NAME
Rheinland Blockade in Omega

15088
NAME
In an unprovoked move, Rheinland has imposed blockades on Jump Gates in Omega-7. Officials have called this “an outrageous breach of trust and protocol that we cannot stand for.” Queen Carina and her cabinet have called for the Chancellor to immediately withdraw his forces, now impinging on Bretonian interests in that area. “Though we have been tolerant thus far,” the Queen said, “this hostile act casts a dark shadow on our relationship and will be met with equal force if need be.”

15089
NAME
Lord Quigley Gunned Down

15090
NAME
We are stunned by the news that Lord Arnold Benson Quigley, Foreign Minister to the Crown of Bretonia, has been found brutally murdered in his home. The Queen was informed and has firmly charged investigators to find those responsible. This is a duty, we are assured, they have solemnly accepted. Thus far there are no official suspects. However, an off-the-record source did say that they are not ruling out the work of The Order, who may be trying to derail the frail peace process in Sirius.

15091
NAME
Shots Fired on Bretonian Soil

15092
NAME
Conflict broke out in Omega today as Rheinland ships, becoming ever bolder, opened fire on a nearby Bretonian patrol in the area. The Chancellor has said that the Rheinland blockade is only looking after Rheinland’s interests in the area and claimed that they were provoked by Bretonian fighters. As tempers flair and peace hang in the balance, Queen Carina contemplates her next move with her advisors.

15093
NAME
Are There Changes in Rheinland?

15094
NAME
News from the Foreign Office indicates that things may be heating up in Rheinland. Reports from the inside say that Rheinland citizens are being stirred up against Kusari by what is being described as “agitator groups.” Meanwhile, the Chancellor has just announced that the military is now activating its reserve fighters to bolster homeland defense. Royal analysts have reported this information to the Queen and have advised her that Rheinland may be preparing for war.

15095
NAME
Who Killed Lord Quigley?

15096
NAME
As national mourning continues for Lord Quigley, so does the manhunt for those responsible for his murder. Authorities, still tight-lipped about their investigation, have recently ruled out the involvement of many domestic suspects. This only further fuels local speculation that The Order may be directly responsible for Quigley’s death. However, we are told that this might not necessarily be the case. Based on new evidence, investigators are examining a host of foreign leads to find Quigley’s killers before they can act again.

15097
NAME
Queen to Attend Summit

15098
NAME
Despite Rheinland’s recent aggressive stance and the assassination of Lord Quigley, the Curaçao summit meeting is still set to proceed. In a surprise move, Queen Carina will now join President Jacobi and other representatives at the table, taking her cousin’s place.

15099
NAME
Disappearances Trouble HO

15100
NAME
Today in the Home Office, a report stated that missing persons cases are at their highest in years. Compared to other population centers in the galaxy, Bretonia has often been considered one of the more peaceful, and so these numbers are thought to be erroneous. The Home Office has asked for a recount and more information before it officially publishes its statistics.

15101
NAME
Ballenshine Was Murdered

15102
NAME
Despite Liberty’s official statement that James Ballenshine died of “natural causes,” several entries in his sealed autopsy report detail certain anomalies. In information leaked to our press, it was noted that for a man who reportedly died of a heart attack, Mr. Ballenshine was in fact missing his heart altogether, as well as his eyes and his brain. These gruesome details were apparently omitted from Liberty’s records. However, they now indicate that Mr. Ballenshine was just another unfortunate victim in a wave of recent high-profile murders.

15103
NAME
Contact Lost with Remote Team

15104
NAME
Communication was lost today with a Cambridge University-sponsored archeological dig in the Border Worlds. University officials showed some concern, but in the absence of an emergency broadcast, they believe that the older communication equipment at the site must have failed. A repair crew will be dispatched to repair the problem.

15105
NAME
Shooting at Curaçao, Queen Safe

15106
NAME
In breaking news, shots rang out at the summit meeting on Curaçao, leaving one security officer dead. Fortunately, the delegates were safely evacuated, and the lone gunman was taken alive before further lives were lost. Authorities believe that his intended target was Gunther Obst, the Rheinland representative. Though the assassin’s identity has not been released, authorities have confirmed his ties to The Order. The Queen was unharmed in this altercation and remains under tight security.

15107
NAME
Rheinland Defectors?

15108
NAME
Reportedly, two individuals claiming to have information about the radical and sudden changes inside the Rheinland political machine have approached Bretonian authorities here at home. Requesting asylum and political protection, these people, whose names have been withheld, claim to have barely escaped a Rheinland death squad. As farfetched as it may sound, it seems our government has taken these individuals very seriously. They are currently being held in a secure location and have been granted an audience with the Home Secretary.

15109
NAME
Rheinland Leaves Negotiations

15110
NAME
The summit on Curaçao was brought back into session only to have it halt abruptly as Gunther Obst from Rheinland refused to re-enter the grand hall. Instead, Obst went into a closed-door, coded meeting with Chancellor Niemann, where he still remains.

15111
NAME
Summit Ends in Conflict

15112
NAME
Chancellor Niemann spoke today, insisting on the immediate departure of Gunther Obst from the Curaçao summit and dispatching several wings of fighters to escort him home. The Chancellor repeated earlier accusations against Kusari and all but accused Liberty of participating in a conspiracy to weaken Rheinland. He then declared Rheinland borders closed to all Kusari citizens traveling in or out.

15113
NAME
More Violence in Omega

15114
NAME
Rheinland forces again lashed out against Bretonian patrols. This time our ships fired back, crippling several Rheinland vessels. Chancellor Niemann decried the altercation as an act of hostility against the Rheinland state.

15115
NAME
Curaçao Delegates Return Home

15116
NAME
In light of recent events, all remaining delegates of the Curaçao summit have been recalled to their respective Houses. The Queen reaffirmed her support for the summit proceedings, hoping that when it resumes, it will act as an instrument to reestablish better understanding and lasting peace.

15117
NAME
Assassin Commits Suicide

15118
NAME
DNA samples taken from the would-be “Order assassin” match those of a Bretonian man reported missing in the Border Worlds five months ago. Hollings O’Keefe, who was apprehended after he opened fire on the Curaçao delegates, apparently died from a Cardamine overdose in his cell. O’Keefe, who had no criminal record before this incident, leaves a legacy of questions, since he died before authorities could learn any details about his disappearance or his subsequent connection to The Order.

15119
NAME
Kusari Citizens Arrested

15120
NAME
Reports indicate that soon after the Chancellor’s recent address, many Kusari citizens in Rheinland were placed under arrest “for their own safety.” Shogun Edo of Kusari was reportedly outraged at this news and demanded their immediate release. There has been no response yet from the Chancellor on this matter, but Queen Carina is also appealing for their release.

15121
NAME
Surge in Local Artifact Sales

15122
NAME
Local Artifact dealers report a marked increase in Artifact sales in recent weeks. Some of this, they say, can be attributed directly to Liberty’s imposed ban on their trade. However, they have also noticed an unusual number of foreign buyers, particularly from Rheinland. Sales topped at a record high again this week.

15123
NAME
Jacobi Addresses Rheinland

15124
NAME
President Jacobi responded to Rheinland’s recent closure of its borders with stateswoman-like aplomb. In her address, she asked Chancellor Niemann to reconsider this decision, to cease all hostile activities, and to release all Kusari citizens who are being held against their will. There has been no reaction yet from Rheinland.

15125
NAME
Kusari Convoy Attacked

15126
NAME
A Kusari convoy near the Kusari/Rheinland border fell to a Rheinland attack wing earlier, eliciting a blistering rebuke from Shogun Edo. The ships, which were on the Kusari side of the border, are said to have been carrying Food and medical supplies to one of Kusari’s outposts when the attack occurred.

15127
NAME
Carina Decries Actions

15128
NAME
Queen Carina spoke out against the recent attack of a Kusari medical convoy. In her statement, she appealed to Chancellor Niemann to end his aggression with Kusari and to work with the other colonies to find a more peaceful solution to their differences.

15129
NAME
Niemann Defends Actions

15130
NAME
Chancellor Niemann finally addressed the issue of Rheinland’s recent attack of a Kusari medical convoy. In his statement, he said that the Kusari convoy was operating under direct orders from the Kusari government to implant a “weapon of mass destruction” near an unspecified target in Rheinland space. Therefore, he said, this defensive attack was deemed necessary to preserve Rheinland lives.

15131
NAME
Edo Denies Allegations

15132
NAME
Shogun Edo dismissed the Chancellor’s statement that one of Kusari’s own medical convoys was being used to transport an explosive device into Rheinland territory. He warned Niemann that he could not allow this “wanton slaughter” to continue and insisted that Rheinland release the Kusari citizens that they were holding hostage.

15133
NAME
Device found in Convoy Wreck

15134
NAME
Rheinland officials have presented evidence in support of their claims that the Kusari medical convoy, recently destroyed by Rheinland ships, was actually on a covert “seek and destroy mission.” In their analysis, they discovered that a device, based on a fusion-bomb design, had been cleverly modified using Kusari components to be even more thorough in its destructive power. Meanwhile, Kusari officials demanded to inspect this so-called evidence, denouncing it as a feeble attempt by Rheinland to justify its war-like actions.

15135
NAME
Edo Asks for Support

15136
NAME
Kusari has appealed to the governments of Liberty and Bretonia in their dealings with Rheinland. Shogun Edo says that his principal concern is the welfare of his people still within Rheinland’s borders. He said that he is receiving enormous pressure to act militarily, but is still seeking a peaceful resolution.

15151
NAME
Rheinland Military Buildup

15152
NAME
In breaking news, large numbers of military ships have been reported on the move in Rheinland and have taken up position along with the remainder of their borders. The Queen has taken issue with this action and is being kept apprised of things as they unfold. Despite the atmosphere of apprehension, commercial and civilian traffic on our side of the Gates continues.

15153
NAME
Travel Advisory for Bretonians

15154
NAME
Eyewitnesses in the Border Worlds say that Rheinland forces have intensified their presence and activities there, largely targeting the pirate population. In light of recent events, the Foreign Office has issued an advisory to all Bretonian subjects to use extreme caution when traveling outside of our systems.

15155
NAME
Jacobi Warns Rheinland

15156
NAME
In response to the arrival of more heavy-class Rheinland ships at Liberty’s border, President Jacobi has called for the Chancellor to immediately pull his forces back. Jacobi has also deployed her own defensive units and has warned the Chancellor not to enter Liberty space.

15157
NAME
Market Falters Amid Uncertainty

15158
NAME
Merchants at home and abroad are beginning to feel the economic hardships of our current political situation. With rising domestic strife and increased foreign threats, spending and trade have decreased in many areas, leaving us in something of a slump. Royal analysts say they are studying the problem and plan to offer a list of recommendations by week’s end.

15159
NAME
Jacobi Proposes Meeting

15160
NAME
In a formal address, President Jacobi said that matters with Rheinland had progressed to a level that she felt required more direct methods. She asked for representatives from Kusari and Bretonia to meet with her on Manhattan to discuss an initiative that she believes will defuse the situation with Rheinland while also allowing for the safe return of Kusari citizens.

15161
NAME
Kusari Citizens Still Held Hostage

15162
NAME
There is still no news on the fate of thousands of Kusari citizens being held captive by the Rheinland government. Though the Shogun has been successful in persuading Liberty and Bretonia to apply additional economic and political pressure on the Chancellor, the Shogun is also considering more direct military action.

15163
NAME
Tekagi Meets with Shogun Edo

15164
NAME
Governor Tekagi briefly met today with Shogun Edo to discuss the Rheinland conflict and Liberty’s proposed meeting. After the short, private discussion, the Governor said that he has been ordered to Liberty to “organize the release of our people through our allies.” Tekagi will leave at once to meet with President Jacobi.

15165
NAME
Liberty to Receive Tekagi

15166
NAME
Amid assurances of heightened security, President Jacobi prepares to receive our Governor Tekagi in the Presidential residence at an undisclosed time. Tensions remain high around Kusari, but the Governor says he is cautiously optimistic, particularly because Queen Carina of Bretonia will also be in attendance.

15167
NAME
Some Citizens Moved to Bremen

15168
NAME
We have just received word that many lawful Kusari citizens, wrongfully accused of espionage, have been rounded up and sent to a makeshift detention facility in Bremen. Officials are looking into this disturbing report.

15169
NAME
Tekagi Arrives in Liberty

15170
NAME
Governor Tekagi arrived in Manhattan today under well-armed escort. There he met with President Jacobi and Queen Carina, of Bretonia, in the hopes of establishing a joint resolution aimed at pressuring Rheinland to release its hostages and negotiate a peaceful settlement.

15171
NAME
Increased Tensions in Kusari

15172
NAME
Patrols have been increased around the Rheinland border in answer to the Chancellor’s recent actions. However, several civilian ships have reported unusual conditions around the area, including “radar ghosting” and other false readings. Some have speculated that Rheinland is attempting to jam early warning systems, but local officials dismiss these reports as the result of instrument malfunctions.

15173
NAME
Ban on Artifacts to Spread?

15174
NAME
Today Liberty unveiled what some have seen as an ulterior motive to negotiations on Manhattan: a potential ban on Artifacts throughout the colonies. Local Artifact dealers reacted negatively, particularly when learning that this ban would be administered by a separate, though still Liberty-run, agency.

15175
NAME
Speculation on Artifact Ban

15176
NAME
Authorities say that the President wants to extend the Liberty Artifact ban to the other colonies to better control the black market. Meanwhile, it appears that the Artifact market has shown signs of slowing slightly, thanks in part to Liberty’s resolutions and political lobbying. Sources inside Liberty say that shipment after shipment of confiscated Artifacts appear to be going into Zone 21 under military watch.

15177
NAME
Niemann Requests Tekagi

15178
NAME
Governor Tekagi’s mission in Liberty has reportedly gone well, yielding a series of directives for Rheinland. Interestingly though, once these directives were transmitted, word came back that the Chancellor would not accept them unless they were personally hand-delivered by the Governor. Despite being advised otherwise, Governor Tekagi has agreed to go.

15179
NAME
Amended Artifact Ban Signed

15180
NAME
Governor Tekagi left Manhattan, but not before endorsing an amended version of the controversial, joint ban on Artifact trading proposed by Liberty. After spending several hours in a secure-link conference with the Shogun, the two agreed to the ban in concept, but only as a temporary measure, and specifically as a means to better lawfully regulate the trade coming out of the Rheinland Border Worlds.

15181
NAME
Artifact Ban Limits Liberty

15182
NAME
As we learn more about the recent Artifact ban, we understand that this agreement also now limits Liberty’s access to the temporarily impounded Artifacts and now allows for the individual House to retain them within their own borders. This was good news to many merchants, as was the generous government subsidy. Meanwhile, Governor Tekagi heads back to Kusari briefly and then on to New Berlin.

15183
NAME
Carina Signs Artifact Ban

15184
NAME
On the heels of Governor Tekagi’s departure, Bretonia formalized its agreement with Liberty and Kusari by also signing the Artifact ban. It is hoped that this initiative will continue to put pressure on Rheinland and put much-needed government credits into the pockets of local merchants.

15185
NAME
Search for Kusari Transport

15186
NAME
The arrival of a special transport and her escorts from the Border Worlds is reportedly long overdue. Several patrols have been dispatched along the intended route, and though hopes of rescue are high, there has been no discovery of the wreckage. The disappearance of the single vessel, carrying a cargo of new Artifacts bound for a museum in Kusari, is ironic since it falls on the cusp of the signing of the colony-wide Artifact ban.

15187
NAME
Tekagi Departs for Rheinland

15188
NAME
The concern is high for the Governor’s safety as he journeys to meet with Chancellor Niemann over the issue of the illegal detention of our people. President Jacobi says that she has confidence that a settlement will be reached with Rheinland, cautioning that any action taken against the visiting Governor would be met with swift retaliation from both Liberty and Bretonia.

15189
NAME
Special Guard Escorts Tekagi

15190
NAME
Governor Tekagi is meeting with Chancellor Niemann under the protection of the Shogun’s own Imperial Guard, who accompanied him through the blockade and to the Rheinland capital of New Berlin. The Governor was greeted with unusual warmth by the Rheinland Chancellor, who was himself surrounded by his own well-armed bodyguards. The two reportedly are going to meet privately to discuss the peace settlement and the safe release of the Kusari hostages. Today, all eyes are on Rheinland.

15191
NAME
Tekagi Returns in Triumph

15192
NAME
Governor Tekagi returned home after an extended meeting with Chancellor Niemann on New Berlin. While the fatigue of the journey appears to have taken its toll on the usually animated Governor, the meeting itself was reportedly a success. As a goodwill gesture, the Governor returned with 150 Kusari citizens who had been held hostage in Rheinland. The rest, we are told, will be returned in stages.

15193
NAME
Hostages Being Debriefed

15194
NAME
Governor Tekagi met privately with Shogun Edo immediately upon his return from New Berlin. There is no formal word yet from this meeting. Meanwhile, Intelligence officials have reportedly begun the process of debriefing the recently returned hostages. It is hoped that they will be reunited with their families and co-workers very soon.

15195
NAME
Kusari Transport Lost

15196
NAME
With no clues to its disappearance, officials have classified the transport that recently failed to report in from the Border Worlds as lost. The ships and crew names are being withheld until the families can be notified.

15197
NAME
Tekagi Exhausted from Trip

15198
NAME
After his return from Rheinland, Governor Tekagi is said to have refused food and sleep and might be ill. Though there is some speculation that he might have been exposed to something on the journey to or from Rheinland, sources close to the Governor say that he needs to rest.

15199
NAME
Chancellor wants Peace

15200
NAME
Advance word from the Shogun and Governor Tekagi is that Chancellor Niemann is willing to follow all of the directives outlined by Kusari, Liberty, and Bretonia if he is allowed more rights to territories in the Border Worlds. This is being considered by the Shogun, who has called a meeting with several of his top generals to review security concerns.

15201
NAME
Blood Dragons on the Move?

15202
NAME
Local authorities have reported that the Blood Dragons may be on the move again. Informants and intercepted communications alerted them to this possibility. However, there is no concrete evidence to support this assumption. The Shogunate has said that the Blood Dragons do not represent a significant threat to our security at this time.

15203
NAME
RHEINLAND ATTACKS!

15204
NAME
Even as Shogun Edo considered Chancellor Niemann’s peace proposal and tensions along the Rheinland border appeared to ease, several Rheinland heavy cruisers and ships suddenly attacked Kusari forces, destroying at least one ship and killing over 100 soldiers. As a result of this unprovoked act, Shogun Edo has declared an open state of hostility with Rheinland — a precursor to war.

15205
NAME
Kusari Border Fortified

15206
NAME
With the escape of the attacking Rheinland ships back over the border, the Shogun has ordered immediate reinforcements to prevent any further assaults as offensive forces begin to mass. The Shogunate cautions that all ships passing through Kusari space are now subject to search and seizure. Travel outside of Kusari-controlled zones is not advised at this time for citizens.

15207
NAME
Liberty’s Bonnerille Dead?

15208
NAME
Word has surfaced here that Aemon Bonnerille, Director of the LSF, is missing and feared dead. There is no further information available at this time.

15209
NAME
RHEINLAND ATTACKS LIBERTY!

15210
NAME
In what has been described as an “intolerable act of open aggression,” warships from Rheinland attacked targets deep within the New York system today. Shortly thereafter, President Jacobi announced that she now had no choice but to declare war on Rheinland. Though she declined to answer specific questions, she did confirm that some Liberty military interests may have been affected by the attacks.

15211
NAME
Zone 21 Target of Attack

15212
NAME
Intelligence sources have confirmed that the Rheinland attack on Liberty centered around a military installation deep within the restricted area of Zone 21 in the New York system. In response, Liberty deployed a significant defensive perimeter around New York, including many heavy military vessels that are patrolling the perimeter of Zone 21.

15213
NAME
Bretonia Remains Vigilant

15214
NAME
Bretonian news feeds are reporting that the government is preparing for any movement against them by Rheinland forces, but as of yet, no attacks have occurred. However, tensions are mounting as several thousand anti-war demonstrators protest outside the Queen’s estate. No one was seriously hurt when riot police finally dispersed the demonstration.

15215
NAME
Missing Ship’s Last Message

15216
NAME
Sources say an Artifact-laden Bretonian ship, reported lost, was apparently attacked somewhere near Leeds. Bretonian investigators have reportedly discovered a weak transmission fragment that is believed to be the ship’s last message. What appears to disturb authorities the most about this fragment is the mention of “unmarked ships” that had come into range just before losing contact. As Bretonia continues to investigate, speculation here at home rises over recent ship disappearances.

15217
NAME
TEKAGI MURDERED!

15218
NAME
The Kusari people are in mourning today for one of the few great men of our time: Governor Yoshinobu Tekagi. Upon hearing of his murder by armed assassins, Shogun Edo was enraged and shouted for vengeance. An Imperial task force has been called in to investigate what is left of the Governor’s retreat.

15219
NAME
Tekagi Investigation

15220
NAME
As investigators speculate on the identity of the killers who took the life of the greatly beloved Governor Tekagi, they say that there is no concrete evidence to support The Order in the list of suspects. Despite suggestions that operatives from the Blood Dragons or even a Rheinland strike force may have played a role, Shogun Edo insists that The Order must be to blame.

15221
NAME
Bonnerille Alive and Well

15222
NAME
Director Aemon Bonnerille of the Liberty Security Force, who was previously thought to be missing, resurfaced today. In a press conference, he said that rumors of his disappearance were simply that — rumors. He blamed the irresponsible media for the controversy and confirmed that he had been sequestered in a secure location following a possible threat to his personal security.

15223
NAME
Dissension in Liberty?

15224
NAME
Unconfirmed reports state that several high-ranking admirals and government officials have started to criticize President Jacobi’s recent actions. There is even a rumor of some calling for her impeachment.

15225
NAME
Kusari Prepares for Invasion!

15226
NAME
Before being destroyed, probes from the Ministry of Strategic Information revealed that the Kusari government has been assembling a massive attack force behind the Honshu Jump Gate, a clear precursor to invasion. The Chancellor himself urged his people to remain united, and he pledged to seek out our enemies wherever they may be hiding. So let us support the Chancellor to assure a peaceful and united Rheinland.

15227
NAME
A Word of Truth

15228
NAME
The Ministry of Truth wishes to remind Rheinland citizens that all of the news and information coming through the official channels is personally viewed by our Chancellor. If he watches, shouldn’t you?

15229
NAME
Jacobi a Traitor?

15230
NAME
Sources inside the Chancellor’s office indicate that the power-hungry President of Liberty has severed all diplomatic ties with Rheinland — obviously in preparation for war. However, political unrest troubles her own government, as several high-ranking officers have publicly expressed their feelings that the President is working against the best interests of her people. Some allege that she could be guilty of corruption, possibly even treason.

15231
NAME
Liberty Suppresses Media!

15232
NAME
Elsewhere in the colonies, news of the Liberty President’s political troubles has been utterly suppressed by the “iron fist of the Liberty media machine.” We are grateful to the Chancellor and the Ministry of Truth for their tireless commitment to the freedom of information that we enjoy here in Rheinland.

15233
NAME
Heroic Chancellor Stands Firm

15234
NAME
In the latest threat from Liberty, President Jacobi has issued an ultimatum to our beloved Chancellor stating that we will be invaded unless we immediately disarm. The Chancellor defiantly declared that he will never let Kusari sap our vitality nor capitulate to Liberty’s bullying and self-serving tactics.

15235
NAME
Bretonia Still an Ally

15236
NAME
As Liberty continues to support the Kusari-backed criminals, guilty of terrorist activities against the sovereign state of Rheinland, and as Jacobi amasses her own invasion force, Bretonia appears to have come to her senses. The Chancellor, a long-time ally, is reportedly now reaching out to Queen Carina for her support in standing against Liberty’s empty threats.

15237
NAME
Jacobi Found Guilty

15238
NAME
The chief conspirator herself, President Barbara Jacobi, appears to be losing control, as pressure is being applied by the Liberty Navy and other leaders who want to remove her from office. Recent information shows that she may be guilty of treason and conspiracy with The Order. Perhaps it is time for the military to take control and initiate formal charges in the name of peace.

15239
NAME
TO VICTORY!

15240
NAME
With our destiny before us, we march on. The Chancellor has struck the first blow for the Rheinland state by crossing into Honshu and engaging the Kusari enemy. With our loyal support, our Chancellor will guide us to victory.

15241
NAME
WAR!!!

15242
NAME
IT’S WAR! Rheinland ships penetrated the Honshu defensive perimeter and are now in Kusari space. Our military forces have rallied, led by the Shogun and his Generals, and are successfully defending our cities. Soldiers, police, civilians, and even the unlawful have gathered together to fight the Rheinland invaders.

15243
NAME
Rheinland Crushes Criminals

15244
NAME
Today Rheinland peacekeepers met resistance from a weak and poorly organized criminal group. They were immediately neutralized and disarmed, and the survivors were captured for re-education and rehabilitation. Praise to the Chancellor for his mercy!

15245
NAME
Liberty President Missing

15246
NAME
Liberty feeds are buzzing with news that President Jacobi may be missing. Local LPI and LSF authorities were called to her residence where a violent struggle appears to have occurred shortly before dawn. Despite concerns that The Order may be involved, LSF Director Aemon Bonnerille says that he will do everything in his power to find the President.

15247
NAME
Coup in Liberty Reported

15248
NAME
Officials inside the Ministry of Truth say that there is every reason to believe that President Jacobi has fallen victim to a coup. The military leadership that is acting in her absence has full control of the government and is considering action against Kusari.

15249
NAME
Shogun’s Reaction

15250
NAME
In a carefully worded statement, the Shogun voiced his concerns that even “temporary military leadership” in Liberty might signal rough changes for Kusari. Reports indicate that several military leaders have echoed what could be construed as pro-Rheinland sympathies, which could shift the balance of power in the already tense conflict.

15251
NAME
President Jacobi Dead?

15252
NAME
President Jacobi of Liberty is missing and presumed dead. Calling it a “national emergency,” forces of the Liberty Navy have stepped in and taken control of all vital government and communication centers. Admiral Bill Baldwin has assumed leadership and established a temporary military government to oversee Liberty’s bureaucracy. No official statements have been issued at this time. However, we will keep you up to date as this story unfolds.

15253
NAME
Rheinland Rebels Take Out Base

15254
NAME
In a brief statement to Kusari news agencies, the Bundschuh rebels in Rheinland claim that they have assaulted and destroyed a high-security installation that housed illegal secret weapons built by the Chancellery. Naturally, this cannot be verified as of yet. However, a long-range scan does show a sizeable amount of irregular debris and radiation in that area.

15255
NAME
Kusari Fleet Destroyed

15256
NAME
In what has been described as the largest battle ever fought in the colonies, a massive Rheinland attack force completely destroyed the Kusari Fleet stationed in the Honshu system. Led by a group of over 40 Rheinland battleships, the Chancellor’s onslaught on Kusari seems unstoppable. The Shogun has mobilized all reserves, and the Kusari Naval Forces are now desperately attempting to establish a defensive ring around New Tokyo.

15257
NAME
Explosions in New York

15258
NAME
Incoming reports state that several large explosions have occurred near Zone 21. Although an official statement has yet to be issued by Admiral Baldwin’s new government, conflicting Intelligence reports have Kusari officials openly speculating that Liberty may be in the grip of an internal power struggle. Meanwhile, in related news, there is still no word regarding President Jacobi’s whereabouts or status.

15259
NAME
Renegade Killed

15260
NAME
In one of the very few official statements so far from the Baldwin regime, the Liberty Navy reports that the dangerous renegade Marcus Walker has finally been killed. Walker, previously a navy Captain and leader of the former Liberty Attack Group South, had turned traitor and openly fought against the Liberty government for some time with his crew. According to the brief report, Walker’s cruiser was destroyed while he attempted to sabotage a naval installation at the southern edge of the New York system in Zone 21.

15261
NAME
Rheinland Takes New Tokyo

15262
NAME
The decisive battle in the war between Rheinland and Kusari ended in the total destruction of the Kusari Naval Forces near New Tokyo. Rheinland has erected a blockade around the planet and has made clear that only unconditional surrender from the Shogun can prevent a devastating planetary bombardment.

To view this amount, click on the Player Status icon (person icon, default key F8) in the top-right of your HUD.\n\nThere are many ways to earn money. For example, you can complete a mission from a Job Board, mine asteroids, sell loot, or trade commodities.\n\nDon’t forget — since you don’t have jump access, you cannot leave the New York system at this time.

NAME
ASSAULT THE EXPERIMENTAL SHIPYARD

23805
NAME
OBJECTIVE:\nLord Hakkera’s key informant in Rheinland, Herr Von Claussen, has vital information about the Nomads. It is imperative to extract the informant alive. Fly to New Berlin, find Von Claussen and bring him back to Kusari space.\n\nDIFFICULTY:\nRheinland has declared war on Kusari and the Nomads now have complete control over the Rheinland Military. It will be difficult for anyone to get into the heart of Rheinland territory, but it likely will be harder to get out with a wanted spy on board.\n\nREWARD:\nThe survival of mankind in the colonies.

23806
NAME
OBJECTIVE:\nHerr Von Claussen’s contacts have located a secret experimental shipyard to the west of Bruchsal Base. Rheinland’s mobilization for war against Kusari has afforded us a rare opportunity. Form up with Herr Von Claussen and await further instructions.\n\nDIFFICULTY:\nEven with their forces spread thin, the installation will still be heavily guarded by both passive and active defenses. Herr Von Claussen’s extensive intelligence networks have been unable to retrieve tactical data on the area. No matter what, that installation must fall.\n\nREWARD:\nTime is running short for the colonies. This action will hopefully buy them the time they need.

*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI still can’t quite believe it. Lonnigan and I had just signed the deal when the attack occurred. We barely made it out alive. From the time the alert started, we only had a few moments before the station blew up. Hundreds of people weren’t so lucky. I actually had to carry Lonnigan to the Life pod because a bulkhead collapsed during the attack and hit him in the head. He’s been unconscious ever since. The medics assure me that he’ll recover. I certainly hope so. We’re currently on a rescue ship en route to Manhattan, but things aren’t looking so good. I lost my ship and my ore shipment blew up with the rest of the station. All I have left is 500 credits. That wouldn’t even buy me a ticket back to Leeds on a waste disposal freighter.

30005
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, after several days of travel, we finally arrived on Manhattan. It was about time; the rescue ship was everything but a pleasant experience. The other eight survivors simply wouldn’t stop talking about what had happened on Freeport 7. Speculations were running wild, and just about everybody was accused at one point or another. Some were convinced Chancellor Niemann was behind the attack, and others accused Governor Tekagi. A Kruger rep assured me that Samura was the only possible group that had an interest in destroying Freeport 7. After a whole lot of useless debate, the majority seemed to agree in the end that The Order was behind it. Anyway, I have to say Manhattan is everything that Tobias made it out to be: a single giant city that covers almost the entire planet. They say that over 220 million people live here — unbelievable. The medics just took Lonnigan to intensive care in Medical. They said it’ll take a while until he’s released. No matter how long it takes, I’ll stay in Manhattan until he recovers. After all, we had signed the deal already. In the meantime, I should find a job. My 500 credits won’t last long. Maybe there is someone in the bar who could give me a lead.

30010
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nNice, after all I’ve been through. The bar here doesn’t even carry a Sidewinder Fang. The bartender served me a Liberty Ale — definitely the only one I’ll ever drink — but after talking for a while, he gave me something else, which was at least decent. He also pointed me to a Liberty Security Force officer who might have a job for me. Her name is Jun’ko Zane. She’s talking to some guy right now. I guess it’s okay for me to interrupt and see if she has something for me.

30015
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI talked to her. At first, she seemed pretty annoyed that I interrupted her conversation, but after she heard that I was on Freeport 7, she was a lot nicer. Seems like I could be in luck! She’s looking for a freelancer right now and said that she’d be in the equipment room later. I also have to remember to call her Juni, not Jun’ko. I’ll definitely look her up — it sounds promising.

30020
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI took the job. Juni offered me an old surplus Starflier and a few thousand credits. The ship is old and doesn’t have jump gate access, but it’s better than nothing. As long as I’m waiting for Lonnigan to recover, I don’t mind hanging around in the New York system for a while. The mission itself seems easy enough: escort a convoy of Food and medical supplies from Ft. Bush to Pittsburgh. I don’t really know where any of these places are, but she said the mission should be easy. I’m supposed to hook up with the mission CO King in space above Manhattan. Juni said my ship will be moved to the launch pad. All I have to do is get ready and launch into space.

30025
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI looked up Juni in the equipment room. She offered me an old and pretty crappy ship and a few thousand credits if I help escort a convoy of Food and medical supplies. Right now, I’m not really interested, but she said the offer would still stand if I come back later. She was certainly not pleased that I turned her down and told me that she’s my best chance for getting a ship. She could well be right. We’ll see.

30030
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAm I some sort of magnet for catastrophes? First Freeport 7 is destroyed while I’m on it, now I launch from one of the safest places in the colonies, the capital of Liberty, and a visiting Rheinland dignitary gets killed. I’m really starting to wonder. I know that I was looking for excitement and adventure when I left Leeds, but this has been a bit much lately. Anyway, King says that duty calls and that we have to rendezvous with the transports near Ft. Bush. He’s uploaded the coordinates of the first Trade Lane to my Neural Net. I guess it’s time to get going.

30035
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nEverything’s good so far. King and I are in formation with the transport convoy. Everybody here is pretty shaken about the attack on Schultzky. To top it all off, it seems the mission is quite a bit more dangerous than Juni made it out to be. The captain of the USV Brandt says that several convoys have come under attack en route to Pittsburgh in the last weeks. Liberty Rogues are hiding in the debris field surrounding the planet and are attacking convoys to and from Pittsburgh. We have to be careful.

30040
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat was everything but easy! I think I’ve been had! Turns out that this entire escort assignment to Pittsburgh was a covert operation by the LSF! The transport convoy was a ruse to draw the Liberty Rogues out of hiding. Well, that certainly worked — we barely made it out alive! King wants to go out again to search for a suspected Rogue base somewhere in the debris field. I signed up for the deal. I certainly don’t want to sit around on Pittsburgh. This has got to be one of the most desolate and sad places I’ve ever seen. King also promised me that it would be worth it. He’s waiting for me in space above Pittsburgh.

30100
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nKing and I hooked up with LSF patrol Epsilon 2 near Pittsburgh and had just started our search pattern when prison ship XT-19 sent a mayday. We immediately changed course and found the prison ship badly damaged and under attack by Rogue fighters. Good thing that we were in the area or that prison ship almost certainly would have been history. Anyway, we managed to destroy the Rogue ships. Patrol Epsilon 2 is staying here to protect XT-19 in case more Rogues show up. King and I will continue the search for the hidden Rogue base. The search pattern is in our Neural Net, and King told me to take the lead.

30105
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter we left the prison ship, King and I flew along the edge of the debris field heading toward our first search grid when we received another mayday, this time from the LSF fighter Beta 4. The ship was being chased out of the debris field by several pirate fighters. We managed to fight off the Rogues. Not a minute too early since Beta 4 was badly damaged. The pilot told the story of how his wing was destroyed in a nearby particle cloud. King believes that they had stumbled upon the hidden Rogue base. We have the coordinates, and King wants me to take the lead. This could get rough.

30110
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe did it! The Rogue base has been destroyed! Not to sound cocky, but we managed to hold off a small fleet of Rogue ships — not to mention that we took out these vicious weapon platforms. King and I held them off until several LSF wings arrived and finished them off with torpedoes. Pretty impressive! Anyway, King has uploaded coordinates to Pittsburgh. It’s time to head back.

30115
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nGreat! I risk my life for the LSF to take out this Rogue base here in New York and then King doesn’t even make good on the drink he promised me. Nice partner. Well, at least he transferred the money. I can’t wait to upgrade this ship, or as King likes to call it, this pile of junk. At the very least I want some better weapons. The Rogues weren’t that tough, but if I run into some stronger opposition, I need some better firepower.

30120
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni called in and told me that President Jacobi has ordered a full investigation into the assassination of Admiral Schultzky. Not surprisingly, it looks like The Order is behind it all. Juni said she’d have more work for me soon. In the meantime, she wants me to spread my wings and take a few missions here in New York. No kidding, given that my ship doesn’t have jump gate access. I couldn’t get out of this system even if I wanted to. Besides, I’m definitely going to wait for Lonnigan to recover. I want my money, damn it! Anyway, King told me that there should be a Deep Space rep on Pittsburgh that has a mission for me. We’ll see. Taking on small jobs like that should keep me busy until Juni calls me back.

30200
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt was about time! It’s been a while since I heard from Juni, but she just called and asked me to meet her on Manhattan. It looks like she has another assignment for me. I wanted to return to Manhattan anyway, to check up on Lonnigan.

30205
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI made it back to Manhattan. No word yet from Lonnigan. I’ve checked Medical, but nobody there seemed to know where he is. Nice bureaucracy! Anyway, I met Juni and King in the bar as planned and accepted their offer. It’s an interesting assignment, and it actually pays well. The LSF is going after a smuggler — a guy named Ashcroft, who is transporting illegal Alien Artifacts in and out of Liberty. Juni has information that Ashcroft is trying to move a shipment of Alien Artifacts through the Colorado Gate. King and I have to find the convoy and stop it before it can enter the New York system. The tricky part is that we are supposed to bring Ashcroft in alive. The LSF wants to interrogate him about Artifact trading in Liberty. President Jacobi has made it the top priority of the LSF to stop all Artifact trading — legal and illegal — and to seize every Artifact they can find. It’s all a little bit strange, really. Usually, these things are just collectibles for people with way too much money. I don’t think Jacobi has told the public the full story yet. The really good news about all this is that Juni has promised to give me the access codes to all Liberty Gates if we bring in Ashcroft.

30210
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI flew to Manhattan and met with Juni and King just now. It was good to see both of them again, but I’m not really up for the assignment. It involves hunting down some Artifact smuggler — not really my cup of tea. Juni actually said that she would wait for me since she apparently really wants me on that mission. I guess I’ll think about it.

30215
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI ran into Lonnigan on the landing pad. He was in pretty bad shape. Apparently, he actually escaped from Medical — no wonder I couldn’t find him before. That head injury must have been worse than I thought. He was totally confused, talked about people that were after him, and said that he knew who destroyed Freeport 7. Something about ships that weren’t there — a bunch of gibberish. I seriously thought he had lost his mind when suddenly two Liberty guards appeared and shot him with a smart dart. I had to dive out of the way or that thing would have hit me. Anyway, Lonnigan went down and I was still on the ground when one of the guards hit me with a stun baton. Not a pleasant feeling — it knocked me out in an instant. I have no idea how long I was out. The next thing I remember is Juni slapping me in the face. Looks like Lonnigan got himself into trouble with the local law. I’m starting to have the feeling that I’m never going to see my million credits. Oh, Tobias is going to have a field day. Looks like I’m going to have to work for Juni a while longer. I certainly need the money. Anyway, King is waiting for me in space above Manhattan.

30220
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe made it to the Colorado system. In response to the attack on Schultzky, the navy has moved heavy battleships to all Jump Gates. I have to say — pretty impressive. We’re waiting for an update on the situation from Juni.

30225
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni just called in. Looks like Ashcroft is coming directly our way. His convoy has entered the Colorado system and the LSF has set up a trap near Pueblo Station. King and I have to scan every ship that comes through the Trade Lane to make sure that none of Ashcroft’s people get away.

30230
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, we scanned all the ships that came through the Trade Lane as ordered. Unfortunately, we got the wrong guy! We found a ship transporting illegal Artifacts and when King ordered the ship to stand down, he attacked. We thought it was one of Ashcroft’s men, but it turns out that we took down a guy named Cosmo Van Nostrom — a real pain. Anyway, just as King started to read him his rights, Juni called. The trap that the LSF had set up near Pueblo failed. Seems that Ashcroft managed to break through the blockade. Contact with Pueblo is lost. Juni wants us to fly there as fast as possible.

30235
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat was close. Pueblo was under attack by at least half a dozen of Ashcroft’s men. The station was burning and started to lose life support. They were lucky that we were so close. But even though Ashcroft got away, we might be in luck. The station managed to put a tracking device on one of Ashcroft’s ships. We have a signal, and this time he won’t get away.

30240
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe surprised Ashcroft while his people were unloading the Artifacts into smaller ships. It’s a good thing that Juni sent us support, otherwise this could have been too much for us. We managed to destroy most of Ashcroft’s fighters, but Ashcroft himself got away. He’s activated his cruise engines and headed deeper into the field. Thankfully, King tagged him. We’ll have to hurry or he’ll get away.

30245
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWow, that Ashcroft has a lot of friends. We chased him into the field, and he suddenly dropped out of cruise. I thought he was trying to get away by taking a Jump Hole, but it turns out that a whole bunch of his thugs were ready to take us down. In the end, we chased them off, and I have Ashcroft securely in my cargo hold. I expected this assignment to be harder than the one near Pittsburgh, but I had no idea how well equipped these Artifact smugglers are. It’s time to fly back to New York and deliver this guy to Juni. King uploaded the coordinates to the Colorado Gate — time to get going.

30250
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe’re back in New York. No more attacks, thank God. King told me an interesting story on the way. Seems like a Rheinland archeological expedition found an entire planet full of Artifacts recently, and here’s the kick — they seem to be active. Ever since then Liberty has tried to shut down the Artifact trade. I just can’t believe this. While I’m trading Boron, the Rheinlanders make the find of the century. What I would give to get my hands on one of these Artifacts. That was the very reason I left Leeds in the first place.

30255
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I hope the information the LSF is getting out of Ashcroft makes all of this worthwhile. King and I were attacked in the middle of the New York system by more of Ashcroft’s men. I had no idea how powerful these Artifact traders really are, and I bet the public in Liberty has no idea either. In any event, I delivered Ashcroft to Juni and she will try to squeeze information out of him. The good news is that I now have the access codes for all of the Liberty Jump Gates. This allows me to jump to Texas and California. Should be interesting since I’ve never been to either of these systems! I also got an extra bonus — not bad at all. Maybe I can buy a new ship. The fighter that King is flying looks nice. If that turns out to be too expensive, I could certainly use some better equipment and weapons. Juni said she would be on assignment for a while but that she would need me again soon. I’ll be waiting. For now, I can spend some time checking out the rest of Liberty space until she calls me again.

30300
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFinally! Looks like Juni is back from her assignment. She asked me to meet her on Manhattan.

30305
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThis is just great! I flew to Manhattan to meet Juni and to also see if I could find Lonnigan. Well, I didn’t have to — he found me and held a gun to my head! That guy has seriously lost his mind. He told me that he had killed a man today. He was still totally paranoid. Babbled something about Freeport 7 and Zone 21. I told him that I knew that The Order was behind it, but he seems to think that it was Liberty. He says it has something to do with Artifacts. Lonnigan said he wanted to warn me to get out of Liberty. I don’t know, he was different this time — seemed focused and determined — not at all the man who was confused just a few days ago. After this pleasant encounter, I went to the bar to meet Juni, and guess what — she wasn’t there. This whole trip to Manhattan is turning into a disaster. Well, at least she left a message with the bartender for me. I’m supposed to meet her on the terraforming station on California Minor. I asked the bartender — the California system is only one jump away from the New York System. All I have to do is take the Jump Gate to California. According to the bartender, there are Trade Lanes all the way up to California Minor. He’s uploaded the path to my Neural Net.

30310
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, at least Juni had the decency to call me. She says she needs me for an assignment. Apparently, Ashcroft’s interrogation was a success and yielded the information Juni and the LSF were looking for. I’m somewhat interested in what that thug had to say. When I’m in the mood, I’ll look her up on California Minor.

30315
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThings are really beginning to freak me out. I finally decided to meet Juni and just came out of the Jump Gate in California when I was stopped by a guy named Brandon Rowlett or something. He said he was with me on Freeport 7 and on the rescue ship. I don’t really remember him, but I think I know who this is — or rather was. The guy was pretty freaked out and told me that some survivors from Freeport 7 had disappeared. He wanted to meet me on Los Angeles, but just as we wanted to fly off, a navy patrol came through the Trade Lane and shot him in cold blood. As the navy ships flew off, they sent me a comm to keep this quiet. What the heck is going on? I guess I’ll keep it quiet, I don’t want to end up like Rowlett did!

30320
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI met Juni on California Minor. Wow, this place is basically a huge ice desert. Why anyone would want to settle here is a mystery to me. This has to be the worst bar in all of Liberty. Juni has less class than I thought. Her mission was interesting. Ashcroft claims that there is a traitor in the ranks of the LSF. Juni and I are to escort a convoy carrying Alien Artifacts from the Magellan system to a secret navy research lab here in California. Only a few people know about the convoy and its cargo. If we are attacked, it would prove that there really is a traitor within the LSF or the navy helping the Artifact smugglers. And just as we were about to leave, the News showed a breaking story that the leader of The Order had been killed. Guess what … they think it was Lonnigan! That’s the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever heard. He was a trader, and not even a good one. He didn’t plan the attack on Freeport 7, but he almost got killed in the blast. I tried to tell Juni, but she wouldn’t listen. I have to say that Rowlett was right about Freeport 7 survivors disappearing, and most of them violently. I have to be careful. As long as I work for the LSF, I should be pretty safe. I’ve to get going. Juni is waiting for me in space and given how moody she is, I better not let her wait too long.

30325
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nNo doubt about it … Juni is angry. I flew all the way out to this desolate planet and all she has to offer is a basic escort mission that doesn’t even pay very well. I told her that I wasn’t interested and Juni just about blew up on me. What a temperament! I might look her up later, after she has cooled off a bit.

30330
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe’ve reached the transports just before they entered the Barrera passage. The passage was built by the Navy Corps of Engineers and is basically a tube-shaped clearing through a dense ice asteroid field. Juni says that if there is an attack, it’ll be inside the passage. We have to stay sharp.

30335
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSo much has happened since my last entry. To say that we were attacked is an understatement. These Artifact smugglers seem to have a sheer endless supply of ships. We must have fought off 20 or more fighters in the passage and we were lucky that San Diego dispatched a fighter wing to help us, or we probably wouldn’t be here in one piece. If anyone needed proof that there’s a traitor somewhere in the LSF or navy, I think we now have ample evidence. Juni landed on Willard to contact her superior. She says we have to fly back to California Minor.

30340
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat in the world is going on? After we left Station Willard, Juni told me that her CO has been placed under arrest for treason and that all of her friends at the LSF have somehow disappeared. She didn’t have an explanation, but maybe that traitor we were trying to weed out wasn’t alone. And then on our way back to California Minor, we were attacked by Rheinland Valkyries! I mean … what the hell are Rheinland ships doing in the middle of Liberty space? Seems to me that there’s a conspiracy going on and that it’s much more serious than we thought. Juni wants to meet a guy named Walker on California Minor. He’s the captain of a Liberty cruiser. Juni says we can trust him and that she knows him from the past. I hope she’s right.

30345
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe met Walker on California Minor. He’s a typical stiff military officer, but he seems okay. He even offered me a job with the Liberty Navy. If I ever take a job with these guys, I might as well admit to myself that my dreams of a life filled with adventure and discovery are over. Anyway, he promised to help us hunt down the Artifact smugglers here in California. The plan is to start our search near Station Willard and to take it from there. We’ll see if Walker can be trusted.

30350
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nRight as we left the planet, King called in. He confirmed that Juni’s CO is in prison. He also told us that there’s been a major shake-up in the ranks of the LSF. He seemed worried. But that’s not the last of it. As we entered formation with Walker’s cruisers, he contacted us on a secure channel to tell us that Navy High Command ordered his group back to space dock for inspection. He seemed very suspicious since his ships had been to space dock just two months ago. Suddenly, we picked up a mayday from Station Willard. Walker decided to disregard the High Command and ordered his group to head to the station. We have to hurry. The station reports that it is taking heavy damage.

30355
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat must have been the biggest battle since the Eighty Years’ War! Station Willard was under attack by several Rheinland gunboats and dozens of fighters. The station took heavy damage, and we barely managed to fight them off. There is general confusion as to what is going on. Walker and Juni are going to meet on the station to try to figure out what’s going on. Juni wants me to take a few jobs and to keep my head down. She promised to contact me once she knows more.

30400
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFinally, Juni called in. I was starting to get worried about her. She seemed concerned, almost frightened. I’m supposed to meet her on Manhattan. I should probably get there quickly and see what’s going on.

30405
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’ve never seen Juni like this. She’s scared — no other word to describe it. She flew back to New York to ask Ashcroft what Rheinland ships have to do with the Artifact trade in Liberty, but when she got to the battleship where he was being held, she learned that all records of his arrest had been wiped clean. But that’s not the worst of it. Walker’s also disappeared. Official records show that his ship was lost five years ago! Something is terribly wrong here in Liberty. Juni thinks our best shot is to look for Walker in California, and given that all other people I know here in Liberty are either dead or have disappeared, that sounds like our best option. Juni went back to the equipment room to take care of some business when I was cornered on the landing deck by a suspicious-looking guy. He told me that he and I were the last two survivors of Freeport 7. I vaguely remembered him from the rescue ship. He told me that the station was blown to pieces because people were looking for an Artifact he has in his possession. Just as he showed me the piece, a navy officer appeared and shot him point-blank. I was almost next, but Juni came back just in time. She told him to take me into custody, but he turned on her and opened fire. She was faster, but now we’re really in trouble. Murder of a military officer is a capital offense here in Liberty and I doubt they’ll buy it was self-defense. We have to get out of here — fast — while there’s still time. Juni says she knows a place to hide.

30410
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLooks like Ashcroft and Walker have both disappeared. Something’s definitely wrong, but I don’t really want to get into it. I have my own problems. Juni wants to look for Walker back in California. I told her that I’m not really ready for this right now. I asked her to wait for me on Manhattan.

30415
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat the hell was all THAT about?! That had to be at least half the Liberty war machine! King tells me that my name suddenly showed up on top of the navy’s most wanted list. I mean, what the hell? I’m wanted for murder, Artifact smuggling, treason, the destruction of Freeport 7, terrorism, and now we’re here with some old guy Juni knows. I should never have come to Liberty. Thank God Walker showed up though. I don’t think we could have made it out of that hellhole without him.

30420
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThree cruisers and a full escort wing, just for a single, one-man station? Juni seems to be holding together alright, but I don’t know how much longer we can hold out like this.

30425
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJeez, even the Bounty Hunters are coming at us in full force. We just can’t win, and everything keeps getting more and more confusing. We’re in it deep. Now we’re on a Lane Hacker base, of all things. I think we’re on the edge of Bretonian space. Maybe being a grease monkey wasn’t such a bad idea.

30430
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nRheinlanders?! What the hell was all THAT about?! What do they have to do with anything? Could it be that all of this is happening because of this damn artifact? I don’t know. All I know is that home in Leeds is just past the cloud. I’m sure Tobias will LOVE this story.

30435
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, Tobias set me up with a good chunk of money for a new ship and pointed me towards the New London ship dealer. Still, I haven’t been home in a while, and all that money is burning a hole in my pocket. After all that, I could use a drink.

30500
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLooks like Juni finally found something…. She sent me a message to meet her on Cambridge. Never liked going there — just a bunch of stuffy bookworms. She says she has a lead on Professor Quintaine. I better get going. The less time I spend in Bretonia the better.

30505
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I flew all the way to Cambridge to hook up with Juni. I know she’s trying to keep a low profile, and that sometimes means blending into public places, but jeez. I mean we always seem to meet in bars. And no surprise — the Professor has disappeared. It feels like a curse — anyone we’re trying to find either dies, is on the run, or magically disappears. In this case, however, Juni found a trail that might give us a chance to find Quintaine: a guy named Vance — he’s a pilot that used to help Quintaine get to the various archeological dig sites throughout the Border Worlds. He’s not too smart and way too much in love with the bottle to be totally reliable, but he seemed trustworthy. Juni had told him that we were working for the Hammer Research Institute in Liberty and that we were interested in funding some of the Professor’s research. That certainly opened some doors. Vance told us that the Professor sometimes disappears for weeks without telling anyone. That’s good news — he might still be alive. Vance pointed us to Dr. Sinclair, who has been working closely with Quintaine for years. She’s working on a dig site on Planet Sprague not too far from here in the Omega-3 system. Then, at the very end of the conversation, Vance told us that a group of Rheinlanders also came by today looking for the Professor. They claimed to be from the New Berlin Museum — fat chance. We have to hurry. If they get to Sinclair before we do, it’s over. Juni is waiting in space above Cambridge.

30510
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s always the same thing. If things don’t go the way Juni wants them to, she gets angry and obnoxious. All I told her was that I wanted a bit more time before I get deeper into this Quintaine business, and what does she do? She yells at me! I’ll hook up with her eventually, but for now, I’ll take all the time I want. We’re partners, right? Partners don’t lose it like that — not with each other.

30515
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI rendezvoused with Juni above Cambridge. She has already plotted the course to Sprague. It’s not very far. We’ll have to take the Trade Lane from here to the Norfolk and from there to the Omega-3 system. Once there, the quickest way is to fly to Freeport 1 and cut over to Sprague from there. The planet lies beyond the trade routes and is a bit remote, but overall, the trip doesn’t seem too bad. The only issues are these damn Rheinlanders. Hopefully, we’ll find the Professor first.

*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe just passed the Norfolk. Sounds like the conflict between Bretonia and Rheinland is escalating. We have to be careful. The Norfolk says that no Rheinland ships have been seen in Omega-3 yet. Maybe we’ll be lucky.

30525
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe’re in Omega-3 and just passed Freeport 1. It’s really starting to look like a military confrontation between Bretonia and Rheinland is becoming more and more likely. The Chancellor has ordered the Rheinland Military to set up blockades in the Omega-7 system, and no foreign merchant ships are allowed into Rheinland space anymore. We’re continuing on to Sprague. No sight of any Rheinlanders yet.

30530
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat the HELL?! These Rheinland ships came out of nowhere! Just as we were approaching Sprague a number of them just uncloaked directly in front of us. We managed to destroy them, but it was close. I hope they didn’t get to Sinclair before we did. We have to land as quickly as possible.

30535
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe found Sinclair, but just as we talked to her, the Rheinlanders attacked the dig site. How do they know where we are all the time? A good part of that blockade must’ve been waiting for us. They blew up the docking ring on the way out. Sinclair says she knows of a place nearby. This is gonna be close.

30540
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nDon’t know how we got out of there alive. I’ll give the Rheinlanders one thing — they’re persistent — annoying, but persistent. As always, another station I set foot on blows up. I’m really beginning to hate space, but I’m not about to die out here in the middle of nowhere. If I’m going down, I’m taking a few of those guys with me.

30545
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFor a scientist, Sinclair is a damn good pilot, but she’s a sad judge of character. So, two Rheinland “defectors” just happen to cross our path and are kind enough to just show us the way out. Riiiight. Why am I always the only one who picks up on this stuff? We just about got killed a few minutes ago by these same guys, and we’re all of a sudden following them around?

30550
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThe battleship Wotan. I’ve heard stories about it, but I’ve never seen it in person. Rheinland is being more than bold, bringing heavy capital ships this close to Bretonia and awfully close to home. I didn’t believe those two defectors at first, but after watching them take out that battleship, I’m guessing things aren’t exactly picture perfect in the Fatherland. Well, time to get back to Leeds. Bet Tobias can’t wait to see what followed me home this time.

30555
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLeeds — home sweet home. At least I know that no matter how bad things get, I can always come back to this bustling brown haven. At least we have a solid lead now, which I’m sure will send us right back into the fire. Well, at least I can breathe for a little and run around the old stomping grounds a bit. Tobias seemed enthralled with my new “friends.” He really hasn’t changed one bit.

30600
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nGreat — just great. Juni’s got me on this wild goose chase for some guy named Dexter Hovis out in the middle of the Dublin system. I bet he’s out on that abandoned battleship. Nothing but scum and gamblers out there. I think they were building some kind of race track out there, too. Maybe I’ll place a few down, seeing as I still haven’t been paid yet. I hope all of this gets us closer to finding out what that Artifact is all about.

30605
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWell, I was right about the track, and I was right about the gambling. The only thing I didn’t see coming was that I’d be the main attraction. Wonderful. At least this’ll be easier than being shot at by Rheinlanders constantly. Apparently, you can’t place bets on yourself. Damn it, I’m never gonna get paid.

30610
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’m not racing this old, backwoods hick. What’s he doing out here anyway? Shouldn’t he be out in Texas or in the Border Worlds or something? Well, in any case, I’m not racing him just so he can get a sucker to burn. Juni will just have to find another lead.

30615
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOld hick got me the first round. He’s not going to get me again, though.

30620
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThat bastard cheated! Lucky for him, I’ve got better things to do than beat old backwoods freaks like him back where they came from. Alright, Quintaine is supposed to be over on this old, abandoned station, the Glorious, not too far from here. Hovis had better be right about this, or I’m turning around and heading straight back. I‘ve had to deal with way too much to deal with some backwater idiot like him.

30625
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI don’t know what’s worse: these Rheinland guys who chase me to hell and back, or this old fart Quintaine. I’m trying to save him, and he dares to try to space me?! Well, at least maybe now we can answer a few questions. Still, I’m glad I’m not in the same ship as him. This entire trip has been nothing but one irritation after another.

30630
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThis Rheinland bit is getting old already. I’ve heard rumors that the Queen Mother is about ready to take up arms against Rheinland. Good, I’m tired of seeing them all over my backyard. You’d think in my own home system I’d be a little safer, but these guys just keep showing up. It’s because of things like this that I left to begin with. Still, if all this goes up in flames, I’ll never be able to find a good drink again.

30700
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFinally, I can get off this hunk of smoking rock and out of this stinking brown system. Juni needs me to help get Quintaine and Sinclair out of Bretonia. Every time that guy opens his big mouth, I want to stick my fist in it. If this is the best and brightest the colonies have to offer, we’re all doomed. I have to wonder — the last time I left Leeds I managed to piss off an entire government. I hope I can come back again one day.

30705
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni needs me to help get Quintaine and Sinclair out of Bretonia — the only problem is that I haven’t had a chance to step out and take a breather. I know they need me, but sometimes a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do.

30710
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThose bastards! They were right on my front door this time! I’m getting tired of this cat and mouse game. Why does everyone want this stupid rock so bad? And how did they get that deep into Bretonia? No matter where we go, there they are. It’s funny. I always thought that all of Tobias’ boasting about his days in the Royal Space Force was just that — boasting, but I’m sure glad he showed up. I owe him a lot, actually. One of these days I’m coming back here and repaying him for everything he’s done for me.

30715
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nDamn Rheinlanders are persistent! How are they blocking us in every direction? In any case, we’ve managed to get out of this mess, and we’re one step closer to … to … Where are we going anyway? Shinden, Shinagawa … Shinkaku! That’s it! We’re supposed to meet some guy named Kress. I hope whoever he is, he can get Quintaine and Sinclair out of my hair. Dealing with Juni is about all I can take as it is.

30720
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI was hoping Kress was there to take this old fart away! Oh well, it’s not too far from here — a small price to pay to keep from embedding my foot in his head. Tobias is going back home. I hope he doesn’t do some damn fool thing like re-enlist. Well, at least I won’t have too much to worry about. He’ll probably do something like hit on a higher-ranked female officer. I get the impression there weren’t any female pilots in his days. Heh, that’s Tobias though. Hope he’s gonna be alright. Well, off to Kress’ base.

30725
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nFirst we have to go through this giant methane field into a giant open area of space where — surprise, surprise — a Rheinland fleet awaits us. This is NOT what I signed up for. Protecting the old windbag is hard enough; having to take on an entire fleet is not my idea of fun. It’s more like suicide. Kress’ men showed up, but they didn’t really help much. What good are scrub fighters against capital ships? Well, at least we got out of there alive. Maybe now I can finally dump this guy. ME-thane?! Who pronounces it like that?! It’s METH-ane! If this is the best scientific mind the universe has to offer, we’re all in a lot of trouble.

30730
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIf anyone gets to shoot Quintaine, it’s gonna be me, not some damned lackey. I’ve already been shot at, electrocuted, and nearly bombed to death. A good ol’ stand-off isn’t gonna shake me. Well, at least Quintaine is outta my hair. At least Sinclair was easy on the eyes. Well, on to Kyushu to meet a Lord Hakkera. I’ve actually never been to Kusari before. I’m very curious to see what it’s like.

30735
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSo that was Lord Hakkera. There’s an air about that man. I don’t know — he’s very … commanding. Anyways, Juni seems to know him, not that that’s saved us in the past. Hopefully, her home system will provide better protection than Bretonia. I guess I’ll do some sightseeing and take up a few jobs while I’m here. It’s not often I get to be a tourist.

30800
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThere’s something different about the people Juni knows in this system. They’re so strong in their convictions — kinda makes me forget about more trivial things. That reminds me — I still haven’t gotten paid! Well, in any case, we’re off to intercept some transport with one of the heads of the Kusari government, Governor Tekagi, on board. I’ve read about this guy in the news. I thought he was working for peace, but if there’s anything I’ve learned, it’s that things aren’t always as they seem.

30805
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni seemed sad that I couldn’t accept the mission, but I still have things to take care of before I’m ready to take this one. If there’s one thing I’ve learned after being chased out of two of the houses, it’s that it’s always best to be prepared.

30810
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe ended up taking this really backward way to Honshu, mostly due to the fact we had to join up with a Blood Dragon wing. I’ve heard of these guys before. They’re this weird type of “good pirate” that roams through Kusari. People say that they’re the best pilots anywhere in the colonies. That doesn’t help explain Juni’s piloting abilities. Well, we still have one more leg on this journey. We have to get that transport out of impound and get it to the Blood Dragon home, the legendary Kyoto Base.

30815
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe got the transport! That actually wasn’t too hard, but I think that’s due in part to Ozu. I’ve never seen anything so surgical before. Ozu’s men knew exactly what to do. It was almost poetic. No wonder these guys are known as legends.

30820
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nTekagi wasn’t aboard and neither was the Tome! Ozu seems unfazed by all of this — I don’t know how. I guess this all just comes naturally to him. I can see why everyone around here reveres him so much. So, this is the legendary Kyoto Base. I guess I’ll take some jobs and earn some scratch while Ozu and the Blood Dragons come up with another way to find the Tome. This place isn’t much to look at, but they’ve got some great equipment here. I can certainly get used to the way they dress.

30900
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nGreat, we’re going into a heavily defended fortress to retrieve a scroll, of all things. Normally this kind of thing would bother me, but there’s something about the Blood Dragons that makes you want to try, if not for you, for everyone else. Heh, maybe this constant hell I’ve been through in the last few weeks is changing me, or maybe it’s just the sense of determination around here.

30905
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt felt horrible telling Ozu that I wasn’t ready for this mission. He seemed disappointed in me. I don’t know what it is, but I feel like I have to earn his respect. I have to get ready for this, I can’t let the Blood Dragons down.

30910
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni seemed rather angry that we didn’t tell her we were leaving. There was a different sound in her voice though. She sounded kind of disappointed. In any case, I leave this mission in Ozu’s hands. He’s the first person I’ve trusted in a long time not to screw things up. We’re supposed to meet several wings of Blood Dragons along the way. That worries me. Just a few of these guys could take out a fleet. What kind of defenses are there that require several wings of Blood Dragons?

30915
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThings are starting to heat up. Tekagi’s men are easily just as good as the Blood Dragons, and they’re coming in equal numbers. No wonder Ozu joined up with so many wings. We had to take out the energy generators on the shield to get into this thing. The way I understand it, it used to be one of the wonders of Kusari. Now it’s a fortress.

30920
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWhat the hell was THAT! That thing killed Ozu in cold blood! What is going on here?! This was supposed to be a simple little mission — then the fat man’s eyes start glowing. Excellent, all this way to see Ozu die. I wouldn’t have even made it out if it wasn’t for Lord Hakkera. How did he get that ship in here anyway? No time to mourn, gotta get outta here before something else shows up intent on killing us. Ozu … sensei … sayonara….

30925
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nJuni ended up meeting us along the way, but so did a few Rheinlanders. These guys just don’t quit. A few moments and torpedoes later and it was over. Juni seemed very saddened by Ozu’s death. I could tell from the tone in her voice. Anyway, Hakkera and the remaining Blood Dragons are taking us back to Kyoto so we can regroup. All this is just getting to be too much. This isn’t what I signed up for.

30930
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI kind of snapped at Hakkera when we landed. So many people have died, and it seems like this constant hunt Rheinland has for us is never going to end. I really wasn’t expecting all this when I first met Juni on Manhattan. I just wanted to make some cash and explore the galaxy. Now I’m some kind of freedom fighter. I’d give anything to have Freeport 7 back and for Lonnigan to have just given me my money. It seems like war is breaking out everywhere, though, and I guess if I wasn’t here, things would be just as bad everywhere else. I better take on a few missions and load up. I’m willing to bet things are about to go to hell.

30935
NAME
*Trent’s Log

31000
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAfter everything that’s happened, I don’t know what to make of things anymore. Juni’s asked me to meet her back on Kyoto. Apparently, Lord Hakkera needs me for a job that only I can do. I can only assume that this will translate into being shot at — a lot.

31005
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI can’t say no to Hakkera. He saved my life back at the Arch, and I have to return the favor. Still, into the heart of Rheinland? This mission is suicide, but I guess I’ve earned myself quite the reputation for blindly accepting just about anything, no matter how suicidal. I better get to the equipment room before launching into space. Who knows what kind of trouble I’ll run into?

31010
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nInto Rheinland?! I know I owe Lord Hakkera a lot, but there’s no way I’m going into the lion’s den! I’ve already been shot at enough for three lifetimes. There’s no way I’m going to the place where they all come from. Well, I suppose if it’s gotta be done it’s gotta be done, but why is it always me that has to do it? Maybe I’ll change my mind later. For now, I’m just going to take it easy for a while.

31015
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nLord Hakkera was good enough to escort me to Sigma-13, along with a full honor guard. He’s got a new second command, Cobo. Good enough kid — young though. Ozu, I didn’t know him that long, but at least he went down fighting. I hope he’s happier wherever he is. In any case, I better get my head out of the clouds and back in the cockpit. Rumor has it that Rheinland has begun amassing ships in this system in preparation for war. Part of the reason I’m even getting an honor guard is so they can strike them before they get the chance to gain a foothold. Remarkable, even though they’re outcasts from Kusari society, the Blood Dragons still defend their home.

31020
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nInsane. That’s all that was. I’ve always heard about the legendary Blood Dragon pilots, and I even got to fly with them at Tekagi’s Arch, but I’ve never seen anything like Tekagi’s Honor. Not only did they fend off the fleet, but they also took down one of those monstrous Rheinland battleships! I wish I could have stayed to help, but Rheinland was only a short flight away. We had to fly through this old, abandoned graveyard of ships left over from the Eighty Years’ War. Eerie. I hope getting Von Claussen will prevent more of these from showing up.

31025
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWho were those two idiots? I’ve never been so creeped out in my life, and after that bit with Tekagi, I thought I was prepared for anything. Well, at least it gave me a lead. Why is it whenever I’m told to meet someone somewhere, they’re never there? It just makes things harder. Well, I’ll say one thing about New Berlin — they’ve got a pretty well-stocked bar. I’ll have to remember to come back one day if all this madness ever calms down.

31030
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt seems Herr Von Claussen’s intelligence networks are more extensive than I thought. He had this man, Hans Fischer, accompany me to Holstein. Good thing, too. Somehow, I doubt that Rheinland would have appreciated a wanted man wandering through their systems. The military buildup here is immense — like nothing I’ve ever seen. The war is really going to happen. For the first time, I have to say I’m a little scared. Still, it’d be nice to have at least a few credits in the bank for later in life, assuming there is a later in life.

31035
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nNow I remember, Herr Von Claussen. Ace pilot and tactician of the Rheinland Military — over 500 kills and he never lost an escort or wingman. I remember reading stories about him, but never in a million years did I think I’d ever be flying with him. I’m actually rather surprised he defected. I always thought he fought for his country, but I guess some things go beyond country and homeland. In any case, he wants to meet up with a Rheinland rebel group located not too far from here, and who am I to say no?

31040
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThankfully, Rheinland has spread itself so thin that it can’t properly maintain its local patrols. That little scuffle on the way in could have been worse. Von Claussen’s intelligence networks have managed to pull up data on the amassing of a secret fleet not too far from here. Finally, after weeks of getting chased around by these Rheinlanders, I get to hit ’em where it hurts. I really can’t wait. Better go stock up — it’s payback time.

31045
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOnly Von Claussen and I made it — the rest all died. It was a massacre … Capital ships everywhere … Botzler’s wing didn’t know what to do. They weren’t as experienced as Von Claussen or Botzler, and they weren’t nearly as skilled as Hakkera’s Honor Guard. They died protecting a home they’ll never see again. Botzler did it all. He took out the entire dry dock by himself. So many people have died. Then, to add insult to injury, the flagship of the South Rheinland Fleet decloaked right in front of our noses! Thankfully, Hakkera showed up out of nowhere in this ship I’d never seen before. Far be it from me to look a gift horse in the mouth. Turns out it’s owned by The Order and commanded by Orillion. Quite an impressive man, and a far stretch from that idiot Lonnigan they accused as being Orillion. We don’t have a lot of time left, and now that Von Claussen is safe and sound, I think I’ll treat myself to a drink. Where is the bar in this place anyway?

31100
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s ironic that after washing ashore in Liberty after Freeport 7 was destroyed, now so much later — I am going back. This time it’s not the cozy Manhattan bar, it’s the darkest hole Liberty has to offer. But we have a mission now — we are to save the President. Again, very ironic since she is the reason we’ve been hunted from the start. Well, that’s just another ironic twist of fate and this is where it all comes together. It’s not about money, it’s not about the Artifact. The stakes are higher now and I’ve got a job to do.

31105
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI can’t believe I’m back here in New York — and with Walker no less. What the hell did he have to do to stay alive? It’s unbelievable! So much has happened since the last time we worked together. Didn’t he once say something about fighting for a cause? Okay, here I am. Let’s get to it.

31110
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nAn intra-system Jump Hole — what a ride! Taking out the satellite wasn’t too much of a problem, but Liberty has definitely increased its security from the last time I was here. The entrance to Zone 21 was a little more difficult. I can’t say I didn’t expect that. But we’ve come this far, we’re committed. Orillion’s last words concern me though, “Rescue or terminate.” Does this mean we may have to execute the President if she’s too far gone? I don’t know how to react to that yet. Whatever. It looks like we’re going to get the president — one way or another.

31115
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI can’t even comment on what I have been a witness to. The President is fine — meaning she is still human — and we have her now. I saw it — I saw what was inside the Chancellor. It was horrible. I hesitated; I admit it. It was all so far-fetched until I saw it for myself — right there in the prison cell. I saw it. I saw true evil. I won’t hesitate again.

31120
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOzu was a brave man. For a long time, I thought I could have saved him. No, I couldn’t. Ozu died doing what he had to. What I saw today drove this home: Walker and his entire crew sacrificed themselves so we could get the President back to the Osiris. I couldn’t have helped him any more than I could have helped Ozu. As Hakkera said, he knew the risks. I am thankful for Walker’s bravery and, briefly, his comradeship. We would not have made it without him and his crew.

31200
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI should have stayed on Leeds. Now they want me to fly into some Nomad base that will more than likely require me getting shot up by various ships I’ve never seen before. Once I get there, I have to tractor in some power cell to activate the stupid purple rock and then get out before it does something silly like explode. Excellent. Orillion says that the structure is more than likely abandoned. After everything that’s happened, I’ll be really surprised if it actually is.

31205
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nIt’s beautiful. It’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. Still, we’ve got to hurry. I’ll have a better chance against those Nomad fighters than I will against the radiation in here.

31210
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThey were everywhere. Absolutely everywhere I turned, Nomads. Even after escaping the Lair, we jumped right into a fire fight. It all keeps getting crazier and crazier, and I have to force myself to believe that this is real. Von Claussen came out of nowhere like some avenging angel of death. I’ve never seen anyone pilot so coldly, and so efficiently. In any case, we’ve got to get back to Toledo so Quintaine can hook this power cell up and we can finally see what the Artifact can do.

31300
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSo the Artifact turns out to be a giant system map?! I have one of those on my ship!! Good for nothing, bald-headed windbag! Maybe I’m missing something. In any case, this base is incredibly impressive — the best ships and the best weapons I’ve ever seen. I’m getting that sinking feeling in my stomach about all of this. Like this is the ride into the sunset the hero makes, or maybe that heroic last stand. In any case, I’m taking up Orillion’s offer and stocking up on all the weapons and equipment I can.

31305
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nSeems like that Hole that got sealed up to Omicron Beta only slowed them down. The Nomads bombed the base into ashes. Orillion had called us down to pick up the Artifact. This thing is supposed to stop all those damn blue bastards floating around in space right now. It’s like a boiling cauldron of lasers and ships out there, and we’re going right back into it.

31310
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nThose Nomad battleships were a lot easier to take down when they were in dry dock. Things are getting hot now, and we’re heading straight into the demon’s maw. I’m tired. I’m tired of running away. I’m tired of being chased. It’s time to end all of this. I’m taking this stupid purple rock and shoving it straight down their throats.

31315
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nI’ll give them one thing, they don’t build things small. As big as the Jump Gate was that brought us here, this, this thing is even bigger. Quintaine called it a Dyson’s Sphere. Now we just have to find a way inside. Everyone in this fight owes the Nomads something. Revenge or a cry for freedom. No matter what, we’ve got to win. When did I get so damned patriotic? Must be all this space bacteria I keep seeing.

31320
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nOh my god. It’s amazing. I have to take out those generators. There’s a shield around a city the size of a small planet! If we can get that shield down, I can shove this tinker toy right into their stomachs.

31325
NAME
*PERSONAL ENTRY:\nWe managed to make it out of there after all. The Nomads all got sucked away into some kind of wormhole above the Nomad City. Orillion and The Order intend on keeping a close eye on it. They’ve even asked me to be their contact in Liberty. Hakkera has gone back to Kusari to rebuild. Tobias ended up getting kicked out of the Bretonia Royal Space Force just like I thought he would, but I think he got a girlfriend or something out of it. Von Claussen was nowhere to be found after the fight. He’s presumed dead, but somehow I doubt that. A man like Von Claussen doesn’t just fade away. President Jacobi gave Juni, King, and I a full pardon. We even got a medal … the Lone Star. Sounds kind of goofy, doesn’t it? Anyway, as much as I appreciate that, it doesn’t make up for the fact that I never got paid. Just my luck…. I’m a hero, but I’m back to freelancing. In the end, maybe that’s not all that bad. There are still lots of worlds to discover and systems to explore. I don’t think I’m ready to call Liberty home yet. A not insignificant reason for that is that I don’t think I’ll ever get used to Liberty Ale.

Famous Manhattan Artist Kidnapped

56001
NAME
MANHATTAN — In one of their boldest moves yet, the Liberty Rogues have kidnapped famous Sculptor John Frankel. He was discovered missing from his apartment two days ago. This afternoon, a ransom demand was received from his captors insisting that a million credits be left within the Pittsburgh Debris Field at a specific location, whereupon he would be released. Frankel’s family fears that the Rogues may kill him even if they do pay the ransom.

Drug Abuse on the Rise in Liberty

56003
NAME
MANHATTAN — A recently conducted independent survey shows increased use of the illegal drug Cardamine by the young elite of Manhattan. “This is alarming news,” LPI chief, Bill Watkins, said as he responded to questions at a press conference that was called to specifically address the planet’s rising Cardamine infatuation. Watkins went on to say that LPI cannot and will not make exceptions for youngsters under the influence. “If we catch them with the drug, we have to put them away,” he later quoted after being questioned regarding the measures the LPI would take against young Manhattanites that were arrested for possession.

Rheinland Expats Flock to Manhattan

56005
NAME
MANHATTAN — Rheinland high society is on the move, and Manhattan is the destination of choice. With the economic woes that Rheinland has been experiencing in recent years, many of the colony’s finest families are relocating to the center of Sirius. “I can live the life I wish to lead more easily here — it’s a shame, but true,” said Gerhardt Schliefner, a newcomer from Stuttgart. Immigrants most commonly cited the uncontrolled crime wave in Rheinland as their primary reason for leaving.

Hazing Banned at West Point

56007
NAME
WEST POINT — The West Point command staff banned hazing today after the controversy stirred up last year involving the death of one of its newest recruits, Christine Belton. The youth died of alcohol poisoning during “hell week” at the academy’s most popular fraternity. “Christine shouldn’t have been drinking like that, since she was a small woman,” said cadet Josh Dawkins, a member of the fraternity, who was the first to report the incident to the staff at West Point.

Record Bounty Offered by IC

56009
NAME
NEWARK — IC announced today a reward of two million credits for the death or capture of dreaded Outcast pirate Santiago Llorens. “IC is dedicated to the eradication of crime in Liberty and throughout Sirius,” said Public Relations Director John Vrimoot. Immediately the Bounty Hunters Guild issued a communication stating that two of its very finest men who have attained the rank of Guild Master would be dispatched with six journeymen Hunters to find and kill Llorens.

Xeno Attack Repulsed by the LPI

56011
NAME
DETROIT — The Liberty outlaws known as the Xenos were routed after a brief firefight with LPI fighters today after they attempted to hijack an armored transport leaving the Detroit Munitions facility. The authorities were tipped off about the impending attack on the weapons shipment and laid a trap, which resulted in the capture of three outlaws and the death of three others. “The alert citizens of Liberty enabled us to strike a blow for justice today,” LPI representatives stated in a press conference.

Corruption in the LPI

56013
NAME
FT. BUSH — A sting operation perpetrated by Free Eagle Press caught two LPI pilots taking bribes from a well-known Junker believed to be a primary smuggler within New York. The two officers were arrested today, a week after the video was aired. Although both officers entered “not guilty” pleas, the evidence against them is very strong. Both men’s faces clearly appear in the exchange caught on camera. “If they get sent to Texas, they are dead men,” said LPI Officer Susan Davies. “Cops who go to prison don’t come out.”

The Badlands, Not Just a Name

56015
NAME
NEW YORK — Tucked into the southern end of New York lies the fields known as the Badlands. In a study conducted by IC, it was discovered that the Badlands is actually the most dangerous area in all of Liberty space. Populated by a variety of dangerous criminals, the field claims hundreds of lives per year. “I don’t go in there; that’s a military job,” said LPI officer Mary Dennis. It seems that even the military and the LSF have their troubles in the Badlands. IC recommends that civilians give the area a wide berth.

Hacker Wins LA Surf Competition

56017
NAME
LOS ANGELES — Apparently, piracy isn’t the only thing that Lane Hackers are good at. This year the California Cup was won by none other than Gilbert Hudson, former Ageira employee and Lane Hacker. Hudson, who entered the competition under a false name, was identified by a former Ageira co-worker, who recognized him as he took center stage to accept the cup. As soon as Hudson saw LPI security guards making their way through the crowd towards the stage, he grabbed the cup and fired a message from a wrist transmitter. A moment later a ship descended from the skies. Hudson hopped aboard and fled with several police cruisers in hot pursuit.

Nouveau Riche in California

56019
NAME
LOS ANGELES — The Liberty elite have traditionally lived in Manhattan, although the surge in recent California transplants may signal a new trend. In this month’s survey in Liberty Style, the superior climate and the presence of Ageira’s research facility on Los Angeles were noted as key factors for relocating New Yorkers. “This is the place to be rich if you are young,” quoted one 29-year-old Ageira executive.

California Minor: Fact or Fantasy?

56021
NAME
CALIFORNIA — With California’s booming population growth many are wondering if Planetform will be able to deliver on the promises of California Minor. The company has assured the public that the planet will be finished within the next two generations. The future prosperity of Los Angeles may depend on that promise. “When my grandfather came here, he said there was a lot of wide-open space and plentiful water; now look at it — we’re jam-packed here,” said California Tourism Director Mike Greeley. “People see how great it is to come here, and they decide to stay. That can’t go on forever.”

Workers Protest Monitoring Device

56023
NAME
LOS ANGELES — Ageira employees are threatening to strike after management’s last request that every employee be fitted with a location transmitter. It would be inserted under the skin as a permanent fixture, which would allow Ageira to monitor the location of its workers at all times. The device was proposed to combat the chance that any more Ageira staff would join the Lane Hackers if they decided to leave the company. “If their intentions are innocent, then no one should have a problem getting the chip,” reported an Ageira area director for operations in California.

Outcasts Active in California

56025
NAME
MOJAVE — The Outcasts are the scourge of Sirius and have now emerged as the most pressing security problem in California. No shipping convoy or transport is safe from the drug-smuggling mask breathers who call themselves Outcasts. They have attacked yet again; this time it was Gold shipments inbound from Bretonia. IC contends that the attack was premeditated and that the Outcasts had inside information regarding the convoy’s cargo manifests. This is a tell-tale sign of Lane Hacker involvement. The cooperation between these two criminal groups can only spell more trouble for the people of this system.

Planetform Demands More Money

56027
NAME
CALIFORNIA MINOR — California Minor is costing more than first expected to terraform. Or at least this is what Planetform claimed today as they again lobbied for additional funds from the Liberty government and other investors. The company claims that the process is on schedule, but there have been extra expenses due to the difficult terrain encountered on the planet’s surface. Manhattan sources speculate that Liberty will deny any further funding requests made before the project’s targeted completion date of 845 AS.

Yukon Will Return to New York

56029
NAME
BATTLESHIP YUKON — The battleship Yukon needs repairs and maintenance. The ship will soon be on its way to the Norfolk Shipyards for refitting and rearming. The LPI states that this maintenance will not leave the system vulnerable to attack from outlaws because the security contingent in California will be tripled during the estimated six-month hiatus. “It’s time the old girl had a paint job,” quipped Yukon’s chief engineer, George Stuart. Although the Yukon will need quite a bit more than a new coat of paint, military officials say that this is no more than routine maintenance.

Two Marauder Players Slain in Attack

56031
NAME
SAN DIEGO — Kevin Kincaid and Reginald Burney were both killed when their luxury transport ship was attacked and destroyed by Outcasts while on its way through the system. These exceptional players will be sorely missed as the California Marauders try to make their way through the playoffs. The team has been given a bye week to recruit replacements from the waivers or with free agents. Memorial services will be held for both men next week after the upcoming match against Cambridge.

Undesirables Still Lurking in the Hills

56033
NAME
DENVER — It looks like the LPI might still have work left to do on the planet. A large group of vagrants and squatters have been repeatedly sighted in Lowell Park, one of the most mountainous regions in the northern hemisphere of the planet. The LPI is planning a large raid of the area to clear out any who do not have the right to be there. “We are going to boot these troublemakers off Denver, don’t worry,” said Denver LPI Chief Sheri Henson.

Garbled Messages Baffle Authorities

56035
NAME
DENVER — LPI investigators are puzzled today as they wrestle with the third encrypted message that has been intercepted in as many weeks. The transmissions are coming from multiple locations within the northern Colorado asteroid fields. Frustrated by the LPI’s failure to make headway in the investigation, Ageira has loaned their top encryption specialists to aid the police effort. One source theorized that the transmissions are using a modified Ageira encryption algorithm, which suggests Lane Hacker involvement.

The proceeds of the concert are going to be donated in their entirety to the “Help the Children of Denver Fund,” which is an organization dedicated to assisting orphaned children from around Colorado find homes with wealthy families on the planet. At five thousand credits each, the tickets were not exactly a bargain. Nevertheless, they quickly sold out. Expect to see the best that Colorado society has to offer at the show.

Hackers Tangle with Xenos

GUNNISON — A Liberty Navy patrol stumbled upon a skirmish between Lane Hackers and Xenos in the Alamosa Field. “It was pretty obvious that the Hackers were winning the scrap, Xenos were blowing up left and right,” reported Navy captain Alison Chamberlain. The Navy patrol entered the fray to find themselves being fired upon by both sides. “One minute they were killing each other, then both groups were raining shots down on us,” Chamberlain added. More Navy ships arrived shortly and the remaining pirates retreated.

Bowex and Gateway Trade Shots

56041
NAME
SILVERTON FIELD — Bowex and Gateway transports exchanged fire near the Trade Lanes leading from Pueblo to the New York Gate. The rivalry between the two Bretonian firms has always been a bitter one, but this is the first documented incident of hostile action occurring within a House system. The captains of the two ships claim that the guns were activated “accidentally” and it was not their intention to hurt anyone. Indeed, no damage occurred to either vessel since the shields absorbed the few shots that were fired.

Skirmish in Rio Grande Bar Injures Five

56043
NAME
RIO GRANDE — A scuffle broke out aboard the Battleship Rio Grande three days ago between Navy crewmen and several Bounty Hunters. Apparently, the exchange began when one of the Bounty Hunters made a negative comment regarding the condition of the Liberty battleship and the poor quality of the patrol craft that Navy pilots fly. The argument escalated when several punches were thrown. Soon, the ship’s bar had degenerated into an all-out brawl. Five were treated at the battleship’s infirmary for various minor injuries.

Liberty Ship Destroyed in Collision

56045

GALILEO JUMP GATE — Samura offered an official apology today to the families of the men lost aboard a small Synth Luxury Foods Freighter that was headed towards New Tokyo. The Samura employee who was piloting the larger vessel claims that his ship had right of way to enter the trade lanes, but the Synth vessel exiting the lanes ignored his ship and recklessly attempted to sweep by the freight train. Many are suspicious of this claim but no one has any proof to the otherwise since there were no other witnesses.

Squatters Appeal to Government

56047
NAME
DENVER — A coalition of impoverished Colorado residents made an appeal to the Liberty government today, presenting a message entitled: “Being poor is not illegal.” The prepared statement was addressed to the legislature in Manhattan and summarized a list of the grievances that many long-time Colorado residents held. They cited numerous examples of revised zoning laws that forced them to abandon their homes for temporary encampments scattered in the hills. There they faced harassment by LPI “squatter” patrols. There’s been no official acknowledgment from New York.

HOUSTON — A recent poll showed that more than 80 percent of the entire population of Houston has a family member that has been convicted of a crime or has served time on an LPI ship. However, only 30 percent of all those employed in the Fertilizer or Construction machinery plants have been convicted of a felony offense. For many, it seems that working the plants is their only chance at leading a legitimate life.

A Debt is Owed to Texas

56051
NAME
HOUSTON — Before the Dallas Incident, Liberty invested heavily in Texas. Houston residents were led to believe that the system would be the research center of the entire House. Virtually overnight the government moved out, leaving nothing but destruction and decay in its wake. Many citizens feel that the government had no right to leave Texas so abruptly because of a terrible government error. “There wouldn’t be no crime here if they gave folks an option,” says Fertilizer plant worker and Houston native Frank Stalls. Perhaps there is a better alternative to solving crime than building new prisons.

Houston Resident Recovers Loot

NAME
HOUSTON — Horace Whittaker was awakened last week to the sound of a terrific explosion outside his home. A smoking crater was all that remained of his backyard and a Liberty Rogue ship that had plummeted from the skies. The next day, as Whittaker surveyed the wreckage, he spotted something shining in the ashes. It turned out to be a Diamond. “I started digging through that mess like crazy,” Whittaker reported. When all was told, he had recovered over a million credits in Diamonds. According to Liberty law, the Diamonds are his.

The Guild is Looking for New Blood

56055
NAME
HOUSTON — They say the best way to catch a criminal is to hire one, and that is exactly what the Bounty Hunters Guild is doing in the following months. Guild masters will be coming in from New York to recruit new Bounty Hunters into the organization. For many, this is an excellent opportunity to leave Texas and make their fortunes adventuring in space. Any applicants who qualify will receive training and benefits, although all pay is earned exclusively through successful bounty collections.

Prisoner Dies in Escape Attempt

56057
NAME
HUNTSVILLE — Liberty Rogue Jerry Bender died yesterday when he suffocated inside the Consumer Goods container he was trying to escape in. The brigand was able to sneak into the container of Textiles being shipped to New York, but he did not account for the oxygen that he would need to survive the journey. His container was loaded aboard an express transport bound for Manhattan, but a backup at the New York Gate caused the shipment to arrive 2 hours too late for the unfortunate escapee.

Outcasts on the Prowl in Texas

56059
NAME
SUGARLAND — It is believed that the Outcasts’ most recent assault on an LPI transport bound for Manhattan was a revenge attack for the recent death of Outcast bandit Jorge Garcia. Garcia had been serving time aboard the Sugarland for Cardamine smuggling and piracy when he died unexpectedly of natural causes. The transport was attacked by a large sortie of Outcast ships from the North Dallas Debris Field as it made its way along the Trade Lanes. Three LPI escorts and the transport itself were destroyed in the attack. The Outcasts escaped behind the marker buoys and into the debris before more LPI forces could arrive.

Xeno Prison Populations Growing

56061
NAME
HUNTSVILLE — Soon a Xeno leader will finish his sentence aboard the Huntsville and likely rejoin his partners in crime. Figures show that for every Xeno that enters the Texas prison system, three more exit. Apparently, the Xenos are using the LPI ships as prime recruiting stations for their war against foreign shippers. This criminal group is currently the fastest-growing illegal faction within Liberty. If this trend continues, Xenos will outnumber Rogues in fifteen years.

56063

HOUSTON — According to New Berlin, the crew aboard the battleship Mississippi is not doing an adequate job of protecting Rheinland ships passing through Texas. This statement was made after Republican Shipping lodged a complaint with the Rheinland government concerning the number of convoys that have fallen victim to Xenos, Rogues, and Outcasts in the system. Liberty asserts that its own ships are offered even less protection in the Hamburg system.

56065
NAME
NEW BERLIN — The Chancellor sharply criticized the black markets and cabarets that have become commonplace on New Berlin. “We must learn to live wholesome lives even in times of economic uncertainty and civil strife,” he stated in the televised speech delivered yesterday. Many interpreted it as an attempt to address the planet’s rapidly rising Cardamine problem, blamed by some on the Junkers.

NEW BERLIN — This Pausbeck’s Day is of special significance because it marks the 500th anniversary of the disaster that destroyed Muleheim. After spending millions to outfit the Ring with mirrors in the hopes of reflecting the sun’s energy onto the dark side of New Berlin, Emperor Pausbeck’s contraption fired a beam that was effectively an orbital laser strike on the city of Muleheim. Every year since it has become a tradition to do something foolish for Pausbeck’s Day, so what are you going to do?

Fists Fly at Reichstag During Debate

NAME
NEW BERLIN — A fight broke out in the Reichstag Wednesday between Dresden and Hamburg representatives during debates over a resolution that Hamburg delegates brought to the floor. The resolution would force Dresden civilians to pay extra taxes to cover the costs of repairing damage to government facilities caused by Red Hessians. Representative Lukas of Dresden was arguing with Hamburg representative Fleischer when the dispute suddenly escalated; “Lukas screamed that the Hessians were Daumann’s problem, not the fault of the people of Dresden; then he picked up his chair, and hit Fleischer with it,” said Rep. Weiss of New Berlin. “A moment later there was mayhem.”

DORTMUND — The LWB managed to destroy another Paste convoy as it approached the Hamburg Jump Gate yesterday. The terrorists attacked the convoy from the Ruhrfeld, a notorious hiding place for criminals. Synth Foods is demanding that the Rheinland security forces send a ship into the old mining area to eliminate the criminal element within. Rheinland responded in an official release, stating that military and police budgets were stretched to the limit and that all of its forces were already deployed in other areas.

DRESDEN — The blue Diamonds mined at Kruger’s Bautzen facility in Dresden have recently gained in popularity among the Rheinland super-rich. More top designers and jewelers are using the expensive rocks that have come to be known as Hessian Tears. Rebecca Daumann, daughter of the current CEO of the mega-corporation, is in many ways responsible for the stone’s resurgence. She has been wearing them to all the largest galas and parties thrown in New Berlin, and her flawless fashion sense has captured the public’s imagination.

KREUZBERG — The scavengers of Sirius who make their home in New Berlin are complaining that just because they are called Junkers doesn’t mean that they will take anything. “People are bringing us their garbage and expecting us to trade for it,” Otto Schumann reported. Apparently, Rheinland’s economic woes are affecting everyone, even the criminals. “I can’t sell it to ALG like Scrap Metal, and these people are expecting me to trade them Food and Consumer Goods for it,” Schumann later added.

HAMBURG — Republican lifter vehicles were filling the hold of the RSV Vonkar when an explosion ripped through the ship’s hull, showering flaming debris in all directions. Moments later, two more bombs went off aboard the recently loaded RSV Valkyrie and Peter Schultz. More than one hundred seventy Republican employees were killed. Republican Shipping’s standard practice of unloading foreign vessels and ferrying imported commodities through Rheinland space is now being questioned by those inside the company, sources reveal. Investigators claim that the bombs were most likely planted in cargo containers aboard ships in Liberty. Unioners have claimed responsibility for the bombing.

Zuggie has been the Juggernaut’s mascot for over two centuries, and though he was an old robot, his popularity was tremendous. Apparently, an overzealous Eagle fan smuggled a Detroit Landblaster into the arena. During the halftime show, just as Zuggie was finishing his act, a rocket flew from the stands and destroyed him. Rheinland Federal Police quickly gunned down the Liberty fan before anyone else could be hurt.

After arming themselves they fought their way to an airlock, killing seven more guards. One guard who fought the Hessians said, “It seemed like they were waiting for somebody to come and pick them up, but no one ever did.” Out of ammunition and out of hope, the inmates blew the emergency hatch on the airlock in an unsuccessful attempt to decompress the deck. All four were sucked into the void.

Despite the timely response of the WVS, the villas were declared a total loss early this morning by fire marshal Herbert. Many locals are turning a narrow eye to the Liberty corporation Orbital Spa and Cruise Lines. The independent Rheinland-run resort was Orbital’s main competition in Stuttgart. The project’s owner, Johann Schneider, had this to say, “This tragedy comes just two weeks after I refused an Orbital offer to buy my property at below market value. It seems like too great a coincidence to be just bad luck.”

Both ships dropped out of the Lanes to find themselves surrounded by the largest LWB force yet assembled. The momentum of the fast-moving transports in the Trade Lanes caused several ships to collide before they could undertake evasive maneuvers. This is a well-known Hessian tactic that the LWB has apparently adopted.

Their recent infestation in this system has caused untold death and destruction in the formerly peaceful colony of Bretonia. Corsair murders often lack any clear motive, unlike the political assassinations that are the trademark of the Mollys. Corsairs are motivated by simple greed, with a startling lack of compassion for human life. The scourge of southern Sirius often carries Alien Artifacts. If your ship is attacked by Corsairs, your best option is to drop any valuables you have and head towards the nearest Police Authority post as quickly as possible.

Bounty Hunters at the station scrambled immediately and pursued the three Gaian ships as they fled. The five killed were low-level Planetform employees, so the attack was likely nothing more than a random strike. This marks the fifth Gaian strike in the last month. Authorities are concerned that the eco-terrorist threat could be growing.

IC is posting mammoth rewards for the live capture of any Lane Hacker, and many Bounty Hunters are getting ready to try and collect.

They are criminals, so they have no qualms about piracy, but nothing is drawing them to Bretonia in particular, except the path to Liberty,” researcher Alistair Jordan stated in a special press conference held on the station. Unfortunately, these findings do not diminish the effect that Outcasts have had in Manchester.

The belief is that it will be more efficient to protect the two facilities if they are close to each other. Projections show that the Newgate population will be at twice its intended capacity within ten years if current trends hold.

She discovered a container of Optical Chips that had been stolen from the Shinagawa storage depot several days before,” the Kishiro lawyers said. A Samura spokesman called the accusations, “A malicious and absurd attempt by Kishiro to soil Samura’s good name.”

NARITA — Republican Shipping has lodged an official complaint against the Kusari government for what it calls “a complete lack of concern over the damage being done to foreign shipping by open piracy.” The Rheinland corporation and several others are concerned about the number of attacks their vessels have undergone in Kusari near their shipping destination, specifically Narita. The Kusari government responded in an official communication stating, “The attacks upon foreign shipping concerns do not vary from the hostile actions that Kusari vessels must also withstand.”

JUNYO — Many of Junyo’s workers are threatening to leave the planetside seafood farms if something is not done about the ever-increasing crime rates in Shikoku. The system is infamous for its prison and the foreigners’ base at Deshima. A large percentage of the employees who work on Junyo are forced to live at Deshima because of housing costs on the Junyo platforms and the lack of alternatives to the Bounty Hunter-owned base. “I don’t like being worried every time my transport enters the Trade Lanes,” quoted one fish farmer about his commute.

FUCHU — Thanks to immediate action on the part of the Kusari Police stationed at Fuchu prison, a small revolt that could have ended in a major catastrophe was avoided. A group of 17 foreign prisoners captured a weapon from three guards in a prison wing and took several other guards hostage. They then released other inmates and barricaded themselves in. The convicts had the supplies to withstand a siege for some time, so prison officials decompressed the area, killing all within. “The guards were probably already dead, so we did what was necessary,” quoted the warden.

Many of those questioned in the polls stated that they believe what the Golden C. is doing is best for Kusari in the long run.

The real estate industry attributes the decline to so many people leaving the planet to make their futures in New Tokyo or Honshu. This migration includes primarily the younger segment of the population, but some older families are among the outflow as well. Many local residents blame Synth Foods and its low-cost foods that are enjoying such popularity in New Tokyo and Honshu. “If those fools in New Tokyo wouldn’t buy the Paste, then Synth would leave Kusari and my son would still be here,” said farmer Hisaki Okimoto.

TSUSHIMA — The ice mining facilities at Tsushima have suffered another devastating attack at the hands of the Blood Dragons. The terrorists made their move last week at the end of the day when the miners were cycling down and returning to the station. Six miners were killed and many more wounded as the transports tried to run back to the station amid weapon salvos. This is the fifth Blood Dragon attack in the past three weeks, and many are wondering if the battleship Nagumo is any deterrent at all.

A recent trend among some of the GMG is to establish residence on Honshu as a home away from their usual haunts in the Sigma systems. Honshu residents have mixed feelings. “Why should we be glad about them coming back?” asked one Honshu native.

GALILEO — Shipping insurance giant IC has once again raised premiums on cargoes traveling through the Independent Worlds. Company executives claim that without additional military protection they can no longer assume the costs of lost cargo, given the current rate structure. They also specifically cited the inability of the Kusari military to properly secure the safety of vessels near the Shikoku Jump Gate. The Kusari government and Samura condemned the action, asserting that Liberty criminals inhabiting those areas were responsible for the bulk of the recent insured losses.

KEPLER — The phantom dark matter storm that was estimated to hit the Kepler system in 730 AS has yet to arrive, and most people don’t believe it ever will. But many residents of the Ames Research Station and some scientists in Liberty space still believe it may be a real possibility. Ageira scientists believed that a storm passing through Kepler would destroy everything within the system. This was the justification used by company executives to convince the Liberty government to build the auxiliary Trade Lane routes and Jump Gates through Galileo. The ensuing scandal fueled the growth of the Lane Hacker criminal organization.

KEPLER — In a blunt communication sent to Manhattan from New Tokyo, the Kusari government blamed Liberty for the pirate troubles in the Independent Worlds between the two Houses. The key to their claim is the number of area pirates that can be traced to Colorado or other Liberty systems. Manhattan issued a terse reply to sum up Liberty’s official position. The Independent Worlds are not the territory of either House, and therefore any pirates who operate in that area are not the personal responsibility of Liberty’s government.

The report also inferred that some Orbital staff aware of the infrequent Lane Hacker visits looked the other way because of potential profits from vacationing pirates aboard the base. “This accusation is an outrage,” said an anonymous Orbital executive. “If it were a private organization making such claims, our lawyers would be preparing for a libel suit.”

The patrol came upon a single Outcast and damaged his craft considerably, but before they could finish him off four Lane Hacker ships swept in and fended off the patrol until the Outcast’s nanobots got the engines going again. The Hackers provided cover for the ship until the pilot escaped, and then they retreated into the Barrier Ice Cloud.

BERING — Liberty has long accused Zoners of what it called “aiding and abetting felonious criminal elements.” In the new law signed yesterday by the President, any Zoners who sell goods or services to any criminal group have broken Liberty law and therefore are criminals themselves. Though Liberty said it would not pursue anyone in the Border Worlds for this new crime, criminals will be arrested if they enter Liberty space. A Zoner spokesman replied, “It’s that type of foolishness that drove us away from that police state called Liberty.”

If Liberty can guarantee the safety of the Independent World system for the passage of a second survey ship, then preparations will commence. Until then it is an impossibility.” Planetform lost one of its ships to Xenos the last time it entered Hudson.

HOLMAN OUTPOST — The IMG-owned Holman Outpost in Tau-31 was the site of an angry confrontation between IMG and BMM personnel this week. An inbound BMM freighter from Tau-23 had to make an emergency docking after being damaged during an Outcast attack. Docking control, underestimating the seriousness of the damage to the BMM vessel, did not allow the crippled ship to land for two hours, claiming that its bay was full. Only when the pressurization system began to fail on the BMM vessel did the controllers realize the gravity of the situation. A brawl erupted between the BMM crew and IMG dock workers when the crew emerged from their ship.

New Tokyo blames Bretonia for provoking the Outcast attacks by pushing too aggressively into the Tau-23 system. New London denies the accusations, attributing the growing losses to increased Samura activity in the northern area of Tau-29.

NAHA — The GMG production group released a 20-year estimate for the Sigma-13 system H-Fuel reserves yesterday. The findings were alarming: a steep decline in gas production during the next ten years, leading to an economically unviable operation by 815 AS. The Council took this as a sign that it is time for the GMG to gradually begin moving all of its operations to Sigma-17. In anticipation of the eventual migration, a new deal was recently signed with Kishiro to finance the expansion of the Ogashawa platform.

The Junkers want to expand into every corner of Sirius space, hoping to exploit the underworld trade in each House. But, true to their isolated nature, the Kusari crime syndicate has kept the foreigners out of Kusari systems. Open conflict has not erupted between the two opposing factions because it is not the Junkers’ way to wage open war. For now, the enterprising scavengers will bide their time until an opportunity in Kusari presents itself.

Nowadays, both the Outcasts and the Corsairs clash in incredible battles of skill and grace, but these rivalries occur primarily because of territorial disputes in the Sigma Border Worlds and southern Bretonia. There is no intrinsic hatred between them, only a ruthlessness that goes beyond any common ties.

It also puts them at odds with the Golden Chrysanthemums, another group that is striving for revolution in Kusari, but for different reasons. The Dragons wish to eliminate government corruption and the Golden C. aims to bring about a new age for women, yet the common goal for these two groups brings them together as allies against the Hogosha.

NAME
Neutral Ground for Everyone

56303
NAME
ROCHESTER — It doesn’t matter what group of criminals you belong to unless you are a Xeno. You are always welcome at a Junker base because you are a potential customer for black market items. From Molly Gold to Corsair Artifacts, the Junkers are willing to buy, sell or trade it all. They also deal in basic Commodities and therefore supply many outlaws. Junker bases also serve as neutral areas for criminals to meet without conflict.

56304
NAME
The Xeno Angle

56305
NAME
OURAY — Many do not understand the radical view that the Xenos take against foreigners and Junkers. The Xenos are the remnants of Liberty’s working-class population in Colorado and Texas. The group blames foreign business interests for the closure of most Liberty factories. Having been kicked to the bottom, Xenos see their only option as clawing their way back to the top. Any outsiders are enemies to them, including the Junkers.

56306
NAME
The Cardamine Connection

56307
NAME
BUFFALO — The trade and use of Cardamine has brought three criminal factions together around the Outcasts, who produce the powerful narcotic. The Golden C. uses Cardamine as part of their ritualistic subculture and distributes it into Kusari space. The Lane Hackers trade valuable shipping information to the Outcasts in exchange for the drug. Finally, there are the Rogues. They supply and shelter the Outcast smugglers on their way through Liberty space. This symbiotic relationship has been very effective in spreading the drug throughout Sirius.

Bounty Hunters: Despised By All

56309
NAME
HOUSTON — Criminals who’ve gone bad and have no problem hunting down their own join the Bounty Hunters Guild. Every crime organization in Sirius has lost many of their numbers to this group and will lose more. The worst insult to most pirates: Once the Bounty Hunter was just like him or her but now is a lapdog to the corporations. Hunters know the Jump Hole networks and how outlaws operate, which makes them more dangerous than police or military. If you have the opportunity to kill one of them, don’t hesitate.

NAME
Reformers Seek End to Corruption

56311
NAME
BRUCHSAL — The Bundschuh of Rheinland and the Blood Dragons of Kusari are organizations that have committed themselves to political ideals over promises of gain by way of murder and piracy. The two groups are motivated by the desire to root out corruption from within their respective governments. The similarities between the Bundschuh and Blood Dragons are illuminating: Both groups believe that it is the influence of corporations that has steered the leadership of their Houses towards corruption and decay. It is also very unlikely that a Bundschuh has ever met a Blood Dragon.

56312
NAME
On a Razor’s Edge

56313
NAME
FREEPORT 10 — The relationship between Zoners and Outcasts is a precarious one. The Outcasts view the Zoners as somewhat useful, so they do not attack them. The moment that the Outcasts no longer find the Zoners necessary, they will have no compunctions about slaughtering any who are in or near their space. The IMG has a much worse rapport with the faction. Outcasts will kill any miners they come across in the northern Edge Worlds. The last thing that Outcasts want is undue attention from outside factions in their territory.

56314
NAME
The Zoners in Southern Sirius

56315
NAME
FREEPORT 9 — Corsairs and Zoners get along together reasonably well because of the large quantities of Corsair Food produced on Freeport 9, but there is some question as to whether operations like it will continue to be allowed to operate so freely by the Corsairs. The presence of Bounty Hunters in Zoner freeports has been the source of mounting tension between the Corsairs and their deliberately neutral neighbors.

NAME
Mining in the Blood

56317
NAME
THE HOOD — The IMG miners, who operate the Hood, get along well with the Mollys, who purchase most of their supplies from the merchants aboard the derelict battleship. Both groups are miners, and though the Mollys have no true allies, the IMG probably come the closest. The IMG are Molly sympathizers, though they have chosen not to criminalize themselves within Bretonia. Like the Mollys, many IMG are former BMM employees, and both groups share a mutual and understandable hatred for the oppressive Bretonian mining firm.

NAME
Red Hessians Accept Fellow Miners

56319
NAME
FREISTADT — Though it has been a long time since the Red Hessians were exclusively miners, they can still appreciate the work that the IMG does to operate independently of corporate and House control in Sirius. Red Hessians and IMG conduct business at the IMG base Freistadt in Omega-7, where they trade Commodities of all kinds from basic supplies to engines. Historically a Bretonian organization, Rheinland miners flocked to the IMG after the Eighty Years’ War, and the common ancestry between the two groups is not overlooked by either faction.

Noted Hessian dies in Failed Escape

56321
NAME
VIERLANDE — Brigade Commander Fritz Hochsted was killed during a failed attempt to escape from his cell aboard the feared Rheinland Federal Prison in Hamburg. He had been sending radio messages from inside the Vierlande to his executive officer for several weeks in an attempt to coordinate a raid with the escape attempt. Unfortunately, the plan failed when his brigade was unable to reach the prison due to authority intervention. The commander fought his way to an airlock and held it until he realized that his ships were not coming. Rather than die at the hands of his captors, he opened the door to the vacuum of open space.

Red Hessian Membership Increasing

56323
NAME
DRESDEN — It doesn’t take much in these times of economic woe to convince adventure-hearted civilians to become a part of the Hessians. Many who cannot find work are deciding that a pirate’s life is right for them. From Dresden to New Berlin men and women are coming into the fold, and it is only strengthening the organization. The Red Hessians have suffered tragic losses in the war against the Corsairs, but new pilots flood to the Ronneburg daily. Soon the Hessians will stretch from Rheinland to Bretonia.

56324
NAME
The Twilight Brigade Destroyed

56325
NAME
RONNEBURG — It is a sad day for Red Hessians throughout Sirius. During a recent battle in Omega-5, we suffered great losses. Two of our best brigades defended Hessian territory against a large Corsair attack force and fought them to a standstill just outside of Ronneburg. “We knew they were going to destroy our base if we didn’t stop them,” said Hessian Erik Schultz. “The Twilight got the worst of it; I don’t think many of those boys made it.” Schultz is correct in his estimation; there are only four living members of the Twilight Brigade after the recent engagement.

Largest Diamond Heist Ever

56327
NAME
DRESDEN — Though Daumann has not announced it publicly, Hessian forces recently captured the largest Diamond shipment in the history of the organization. The Black Wolves launched an attack upon two armored transports as they made their way towards the New Berlin Gate. Some casualties occurred, but they died for the glory of the workers of Rheinland. Fleet Commander Heinrich Pulger coordinated the planning of the attack using detailed information he learned about the shipment from sources inside Daumann.

NEW TOKYO — Noted Hogosha criminal Taki Fujimata met an unfortunate demise in his residence a few days ago at the hands of Blood Dragon commandos. Fujimata was responsible for the strikes upon six intelligence-gathering operatives that were in position in New Tokyo. His death insures greater mobility and safety for our undercover agents in the capital. Fujimata was a well-liked figure within the Hogosha leadership, and rumors are already circulating that a reprisal attack may soon be forthcoming.

56331
NAME
CHUGOKU — With the approach of the Sakura Festival, the Blood Dragons will mourn the anniversary of the fall of the Hideyoshi Shogunate. This is a day of great shame not only for the Blood Dragons but for all the people of Kusari. It is our sacred role to reestablish a legitimate government. On this anniversary Kusari will be reminded of how our honor was taken from us. Expect a day of reckoning during the upcoming Sakura Festival. Our leaders shall not let the travesty that occurred centuries ago be forgotten.

A Close Call

56333
NAME
KYOTO — Two Kusari Naval Forces fighters were intercepted yesterday by a patrol near the Hokkaido Jump Hole. It is theorized that they stumbled across the Hole in the Kayo Cloud by accident. Five more ships were immediately dispatched to the area, and the hunt began. The two ships were destroyed just as they were about to exit the system. Fortunately, the high electromagnetic interference present in the Kayo Cloud most likely prevented them from making contact with the Matsumoto.

Liberty Rogues Won’t Help Junkers

56335
NAME
ROCHESTER — The Rogues have decided not to take sides in the fighting between the Junkers and the Xenos. This decision has raised some tensions in Rochester, where the Junkers are most commonly harassed by Xeno attacks. “We supply the Rogues with almost everything they need. It just ain’t right, them not helping us against those crazy Xenos,” said Junker Abraham Washington. A Rogue pilot who was questioned about the decision had this to say, “It isn’t our place getting into the middle of a fight between two groups we’ve got nothing personal against.”

56336
NAME
Rochester: Junker Paradise

56337
NAME
ROCHESTER — You can get anything you want in Rochester, from Cardamine to Niobium, and the Junkers who live and work there are proud of that fact. “We have the most extensive supply of black market items available in Sirius, and it hasn’t been easy getting to that point,” Said Jerry Greeley, a Junker merchant. The debris fields of New York supply the Junkers not only with the best stock around, but with all the Scrap Metal they need and plenty of good hiding places to conduct their off-base business transactions.

Rogue Murdered in Bar Dispute

56339
NAME
BEAUMONT — Wayne Hancock, a well-liked Liberty Rogue, was killed three days ago when he angered an Outcast drinking next to him at the bar in Beaumont. It is rumored that the two men were arguing, and the Outcast simply drew a weapon and killed the unlucky Rogue. “I heard Wayne say something about how the masks the Outcasts wear look silly. The next thing I know he’s out of his stool and on the floor with four shots in his belly,” said John Kincaid, the bartender who was serving the two.

Outcasts Annihilate Xeno Force

56341
NAME
BEAUMONT — A flight of Outcast Cardamine runners was recently attacked by Hudson Xenos near the West Dallas Debris Field. The Xenos underestimated the skill and ships of the Outcasts and quickly found themselves on the losing side of the battle. The three Outcast ships destroyed all of the eight Xeno attack vessels in the skirmish. The Junkers, enemies of the foreign-hating Liberty criminal group, may have found a new ally.

A Corsair and Outcast Romance?

56343
NAME
TRAFALGAR — Junkers were surprised last Wednesday to see a female Corsair and a male Outcast having what looked to be an intimate conversation in the Trafalgar lounge area. It is well known that when Corsairs and Outcasts meet in space, a fierce battle usually ensues, but that might not be the case when they aren’t aboard their ships. “I thought they were going to fight when I first noticed them, that is until I heard the woman laughing, I’ve never heard a Corsair laugh before,” said Roger Watkins, Trafalgar bartender.

56344
NAME
Confusion over Junkers Return Policy

56345
NAME
TRAFALGAR — It is a hard and fast rule of the Junkers: There are no refunds on anything purchased from our supplies. One of the disadvantages of dealing in black market items is the fact that once you buy something you cannot return it. This rule was a point of contention between Trafalgar Junkers and Mollys. The Mollys, angered over some improperly functioning ship engines they had purchased, demanded full refunds. It looked like things might get out of hand before Molly Captain Jacob Crowe overheard the commotion and put a stop to it, siding with reason and ordering his men to accept the deal.

56346
NAME
Blue Diamond Prices Going Up

56347
NAME
KREUZBERG — The Red Hessians are demanding more for Dresden Diamonds recently and are getting what they ask for. Because of a recent craze for blue Diamonds among the Rheinland elite, it looks like the market is going to bear the higher prices. “It’s really getting ridiculous, the prices they are charging,” said Junker Wilhelm Flores. “They expect fair prices from us, so it should work both ways.” The Red Hessians claim that it is becoming harder to smuggle the Diamonds from the Schwefelnebel. “We lose men and ships every day getting Diamonds here,” said a Hessian smuggler on the situation.

LWB Will Pay for Info on Synth Foods

56349

STUTTGART — The LWB has alerted Kreuzberg that they are looking to buy information about Synth Foods’ activities. “We don’t have all the information we need about their activities and that is hampering our abilities to coordinate an effective resistance against Synth Foods,” said LWB representative Dietrich Leffler. Though the LWB is not renowned as a particularly wealthy or large organization they have made it clear that accurate information will be well rewarded. “We need shipping routes and times, as well as dossiers on top Synth executives,” said Leffler.

YANAGI — Rheinland Junkers are feeling the heat as Rheinland passes more rigorous inspection standards in an attempt to stop the flow of Cardamine into the colony. Junkers have been forced to design more imaginative ways to get the drug into Rheinland space. “The authorities are a bit short of cash right now, so we’ve been able to slip by quite a few State Police patrols with a little extra credits on hand. Usually it works, but sometimes it doesn’t, so you have to be prepared to hit the afterburner,” said Junker smuggler Sonja Kerns.

YANAGI — Every ten years the organization of men and women who call themselves Junkers comes together at one of the Junker bases; this time around Yanagi will host the event. It is a time for all Junkers to come together to trade wares, ideas, routes, and tales as they review the past decade. New leadership positions will be granted to replace comrades who are no longer with us. New blood will also be brought into the fold with our “Become a Junker” dinner held for Junker children coming of age.

Xenos Gain Ground for Workers

56355
NAME
COLORADO — Even if the Liberty government is too spineless to assert the rights of the strongest of the colony Houses, the Xenos still represent the aims of the working class in this space. The Kusari and Rheinland shippers have encountered a new foe as they enter our turf trying to sell their inferior goods to Libertonians, who deserve better. Though our numbers are small, our hearts and backs are strong, and we will prevail. There is no place for the Kusari or Rheinland in Liberty.

56356

56357
NAME
NEW YORK — This time Liberty’s finest managed to pull off the biggest Xeno Side Arm score in as long as anyone can remember. Twelve of our pilots hit an Ageira armored transport filled with the finest weapons made in Detroit. We only lost four pilots, and now it looks like there will be weapons for everybody. There will be a special sale at the Commodity dealer to clear out the excess inventory. All friends of the Xenos are welcome.

More Folks Coming in from Texas

56359

OURAY — Most of the people that our brotherhood can recruit from the Huntsville usually end up doing their duty in Hudson, but it looks like we might be getting a good number of members from Texas in the next few weeks. Jake Brown, one of our comrades in arms who is languishing in prison down south, is getting out soon, and according to reports, he’s bringing some new recruits with him. Brown was put away when he tangled with one too many LPI ships near Chisos a couple of years ago. Now it looks like his loss is our gain.

Luxury Goods Available

56361
NAME
HUDSON — A Republican Shipping convoy carrying Luxury Goods through Hudson on its way to Liberty space was attacked and destroyed by Xeno freedom fighters a few days ago. Since nobody we deal with has the money to buy the goods, we are distributing them to our own brethren to improve the quality of life for Xenos in this part of space. Even if you don’t care about Niobium statues and post-neo contemporary paintings, come see what there is; you might find something you like.

Attack on Junker Base a Success

56363
NAME
BEAUMONT — It looks like the Junkers will be licking their wounds for quite some time after the most recent Xeno attack at their base in Texas. Our boys came cruising in just as a few Outcast ships were docking at the base. They let lose with a volley of missiles and cruised back out before the Junkers and Outcasts knew what had hit them. “I saw both of my missiles hit home against the base, and there were explosions everywhere,” says Harry Nash, one of our own, about the attack on Beaumont.

56364
NAME
Cardamine is the Future

56365
NAME
BARROW — What’s the best way to get rid of the corporates and the rich in New York? Cardamine. It must become every Xeno’s goal to wrestle away control of the Cardamine from the Junkers in Liberty. If we could find a way to take over their supplies, we could use the drug to control the Manhattan addicts. This would put us in a much stronger financial position and give us the ability to upgrade our weapons and fleet. Then we could truly begin the revolution that would set the Libertonian working-class free from the bonds of corruption that restrict so many of us.

Hogosha Candidate Wins Election

56367
NAME
NEW TOKYO — Ryuku Daisama is celebrating tonight in New Tokyo, along with many of our leaders. Daisama was supported by the Hogosha because of his efforts to curb crime in Kusari space. He is a fierce opponent of the Blood Dragons and Golden Chrysanthemums, and his newly won position on the Interstellar Board of Crime Management will help bolster his efforts throughout all of our space. The Hogosha will soon be backing another lucky candidate in the race for the next open position on the board. If you would like to support our efforts, contributions are always accepted.

Hogosha Leader Dishonors Himself

56369
NAME
SHIKOKU — One of our own is on his way to Shikoku where he will serve a twelve-year sentence for trafficking Cardamine. This terrible crime must not be perpetrated by the protectors of the Kusari people. The underboss was caught when two of his street-level distributors were apprehended and confessed to working for him. This man has been disavowed by the Hogosha, and it is unlikely that he will live to see the end of his prison sentence. The Hogosha will not tolerate the sale of Cardamine as a means to make money.

Artifact Prices Drop for Distributors

56371
NAME
SIGMA-19 — It looks like the profit margins on Artifacts are increasing, which should delight many of our distributors in New Tokyo. The GMG was recently cut out of the Artifact trade between the Hogosha and the Corsairs, resulting in better prices for our organization. Contact was made with Corsair representatives on the Hawaii, and our negotiators offered the pirates more than the GMG was paying them for the Artifacts, but less than the Miners Guild was charging the Hogosha. It looks like everyone will profit, except the GMG.

CURAÇAO — None of our numbers have ever been captured alive, but that fact almost changed recently when one of our own was identified while she was on an impromptu vacation in Curaçao. Sue Williams found herself surrounded by undercover IC operatives at the Orbital Spa and Cruise Lines Resort last week. She was able to send a distress call to a patrol that was passing near the planet. “We got her message. She seemed worried, so Jake and I went to get her out of there,” quoted Hacker pilot Robert Butcher. The two pilots flew in and picked her up just as the IC agents were about to close in.

MAGELLAN — Despite increased bounties offered by IC and Ageira, Lane Hacker operations are just as successful as ever. This quarter both bases posted record profits from lucrative heists that we pulled off. “I don’t know how Liberty ever gets any Gold from Bretonia with the operations we are pulling,” Lane Hacker executive Bill Hunter quoted. Privately many members admit that mounting Cardamine abuse could be a serious drain on Hacker income if not curbed soon.

LEIDEN — The days of trading information with the Outcasts for Cardamine may soon be drawing to an end as Outcasts threaten to boost Cardamine prices. “The Outcasts have to realize what a service they are getting by trading us for information,” said division manager Gary Holden, “If they try and put the squeeze on us, then they are going to lose millions when they stop getting all those choice shipments.” Information will be withheld from the Edge World Cardamine suppliers if they hike the prices again.

Artifacts Out of Vogue

56379
NAME
MACTAN — Every Hacker has Artifacts these days, and it looks like there isn’t much of a market for them among our own numbers. This is a good thing since we can sell directly on Liberty’s black market. “We’ll make more off them if we stop picking the best ones for ourselves anyway, plus with the new ban on Artifacts, the prices should go up, netting us more in the long run,” quoted John Gustafson.

GALILEO — Gary Burnam, William Lieberman, and Hamilton Jones were all killed when they stumbled into an IC/Bounty Hunter trap last week. The three pilots attacked a Kusari Luxury Goods armored transport as it approached the Galileo Jump Gate in Colorado. They sent a distress call just as they made their first pass. The reports are inconclusive, but it is believed that four Hunter ships were hidden in the transport’s relay signature. Flight leader Burnam gave the order to retreat, but shortly afterward all three of their com-signals went dead. A day later IC paid the Guild three pilot bounties.

COLORADO — Our code breakers cracked the new encryption code that Ageira designed to protect its USI systems. It would not have been possible without the help of our company operatives. It looks like we are still one step ahead of the game; Ageira will have to come up with another way of stopping us from conducting business. Scores of Lane Hackers still work for Ageira and act as informants for our organization. Through their brave contributions, we continue to prosper.

56385
NAME
DUBLIN — Dublin is ours, though it looks like we will have to protect our system and our Gold not only from the Bretonian government but from the Corsairs too. Their raids in this system have become increasingly frequent. Over the past month, Mollys have destroyed more than fifteen Corsair ships, but at a price. Six of us will draw breath no more because of these new intruders. We must remain vigilant against these new foes, who are tougher and meaner than any Bretonian military.

The Bretonian military cannot stop us from running operations in this system, nor are things much better for them in the rest of Bretonia, where we can operate freely. Despite setbacks, we have managed to fight Bretonia to a standstill, and we shall continue until we turn the tide. One day the Crown will realize that Dublin is not worth what it must pay to keep her.

ARRANMORE — The military came too close to our asteroid field this past week and it cost them a gunboat and all hands. The Reginald Harris pursued three of our fighters from the safety of the Essex to the boundaries of our asteroid field, where it paid the price. Five more ships stood ready when the gunboat approached the perimeter of the field, and when she got into range, they let loose with a precisely fired missile salvo into the Harris’ engines. The captain tried to retreat, but with the engines destroyed it was just a matter of dragging the ship into the minefield and letting the mines destroy her.

NEW BERLIN — In a press release issued today the Rheinland government stated that industrial casualties are declining. This information was compiled from annual worker statistics generated by Daumann, Kruger, and Republican. Government officials applauded the companies for their strict adherence to the Workers Rights Convention. Do not be fooled; this is nothing more than propaganda created to lull you into apathy. The truth is that these corporations ignore the Convention. Overworked, overpaid miners die every day using unsafe equipment. Metal workers fall into vats of molten metal daily, too tired to be careful. This is no time for complacency.

This is unfortunate because justice loses a powerful ally, but all is not lost. Some of the more enlightened members of the Hessians are not satisfied with being common thieves and are coming to the Bundschuh to continue the fight against Rheinland’s corrupt regime. Many of these new members are experienced pilots, tacticians, and soldiers — just what we need to fight our oppressors.

Three men in black jumped out of the marauding craft and unloaded handheld weapons into Rogers’ skiff. Her driver and personal assistant were both killed in the hail of gunfire. Though it is an unfortunate tragedy, we are lucky not to lose Rogers, one of our best lobbyists. She only suffered minor injuries.

The small multicolored bird that populated the forests of Gaia is rapidly declining in numbers because of the sickness caused by the alien bacteria. The bacteria make the eggs of the wind bird extremely brittle and susceptible to breakage before the fetuses can fully develop. The bacteria have been identified as originating from Leeds and must have been transported by a tourist aboard Orbital Spa’s Shetland liner. The wind bird has been the focus of many works of art because of its dazzling beauty and iridescent feathers.

MANCHESTER — Ice asteroids are a terraformer’s best friend. Ice asteroids found in a system are dumped into the planet’s atmosphere in a warped attempt to change the planet from its natural state into an artificial ecosystem for human beings. Now it looks like ice asteroids may become the terraformer’s worst enemy. A Planetform, Inc. ship slammed into an ice asteroid last week, completely destroying the craft. The asteroid had been dragged by our ships into the Trade Lanes just before a scheduled Planetform run through that area. The regrettable loss of life will stop once Planetform ceases its operation.

ALTONA — Unioners are celebrating tonight after a critical success for the cause in Hamburg yesterday. Four Republican vessels were destroyed in a lightning strike upon the enemy base. Rheinland Federal Police responded quickly to the distress call of the Republican ships, but they arrived too late. Our attack force was already cruising for the Jump Hole out of the system. The success of the mission was attributed to the gunnery skills of the attacking pilots, who scored direct hits with all of their missile salvos.

The Synth ship was able to flee while our forces engaged the foreign menace. Unioner pilots have been fighting turf wars with the Xenos in Hudson for some time; soon they will be overcome and destroyed.

Unfortunately, a potential sister of ours turned out to be nothing more than an agent for the chauvinists trying to oppress her own gender. We must enlighten women like her that have been dragged from the truth by the brainwashing of the patriarchal Kusari culture.

Soon 80 percent of Stuttgart will be in the hands of Synth, and the climate has already been irrevocably changed. This is not a call for surrender, but a renewal of will against the accursed Liberty corporation. The steps we have been taking to stop the foreign company are not enough; we must intensify pressure to free our lands.

DARMSTADT — LWB leaders are planning a massive strike on Synth Food operations next week on the one-hundredth anniversary of the Liberty company’s invasion of Stuttgart. The details of the plan have not yet been released, but LWB veterans have been warned to be available for a large-scale operation. This plan only includes members of the LWB whose family had land taken from them by Synth Foods, since the risk factor is rumored to be very high. Next week will be one of great importance for our small band of freedom fighters.

Biodome Knocked Out in Deshima

56417
NAME
SHIKOKU — Farmers Alliance commandos planted a bomb in the biodome in Deshima several days ago. Both operatives were able to escape before the timer went off. According to reports, the dome will not produce food for several weeks. This is a symbolic victory for the Alliance. There is no place for a Synth Foods biodome in Kusari space, and soon the foreigners will come to learn that fact. The injuries caused by the explosion are regrettable, yet necessary when compared to the terrible price that the people of Kusari will pay if the Liberty corporation takes over.

NAME
Alliance Enjoys Strong Support

56419
NAME
KYUSHU — A poll recently taken by an independent news group found that the Farmers Alliance is very popular among a large portion of the Kyushu populace. Obviously, Alliance propaganda is taking effect in the minds and hearts of the people of the system. Our organization enjoys particular support from the older, wiser generations living on the planet. Soon people will begin to realize that it was a mistake to let foreigners come into our space. It will not be long before the Farmers Alliance movement is sweeping through the empire.

Kyushu Rice is Healthiest Choice

56421
NAME
NEW TOKYO — Though many complain of the higher price that comes with Kyushu foods, they do not think of the benefits their bodies are receiving from eating naturally grown foods. A recent study conducted by an independent organization discovered that Synth Paste can damage a person’s long-term health and cause hair loss. The synthetic swill they pump from their biodomes is chiefly chemicals and dye. Remember to tell people this information when they complain about the prices of our foods, because you cannot place a price on good health.

Life is Good in New York

56423
NAME
BUFFALO — New York has the best that life has to offer for a criminal in Liberty. Here in the center of Sirius, one can travel through the system aided by the numerous debris fields. Additionally, the Badlands hide Buffalo from the prying eyes of the military and the LPI. Everything is provided for those that have the guts to take it. Cardamine and loot are readily available, and if you get captured by the LPI, then room and board are free. If a Bounty Hunter pops you, then you aren’t feeling any pain anyway.

The LPI Steps it up in Pittsburgh

56425
NAME
PITTSBURGH — Rogues have been encountering more patrols than usual near Pittsburgh these days. If you decide to do some hunting in that area, be careful and stay hidden in the Pittsburgh fields as much as possible. Junker sources believe that the increased patrols are due to LPI’s recent “Get Tough on Crime” campaign that they have been waging against the party crowd in Liberty. LPI pilots are getting paid bonuses to bring us in, so they are going deeper into the debris than they normally do.

56426
NAME
Largest Cardamine Haul Ever

56427
NAME
ALCATRAZ — Rogue pilots recently smuggled a large shipment of Cardamine from California all the way to the Junkers at Rochester in New York. “Things got a little tense when we realized that we were being ghosted by a couple of Hunters, but we managed to get away from them — Woohoo!” cried Terry Donovan, one of the successful smugglers.

56428
NAME
New Recruits to Receive Training

56429
NAME
ALCATRAZ — Leaders from around Liberty came together in California this week to discuss the possibility of training newer Rogue members to become better pilots and smugglers. “If we could take the acquired knowledge of our more experienced members and share it with some of the scrubs, then we’d have fewer casualties among our junior members,” said Montezuma chief, Nick Creeley. This is all part of a Rogue effort everywhere to try and become a more effective force within Liberty and Sirius.

Xenos Get Hammered By Unioners

56431
NAME
DAWSON — It looks like some of the Xenos in this system lost a pretty big fight with the Rheinland Unioners last week. Everybody knows that the Xenos are trying to get in on the Diamond trade — so far unsuccessfully. The case was no different this time when four Xenos attacked Unioners heading through the Wrangell Field towards Dawson to do some Diamond trading. Rogue pilots held back and watched as the Xenos got torn apart by the more experienced Unioner pilots.

56432
NAME
No Bounties for these Hunters

56433
NAME
KENAI FIELD — A small flight of Bounty Hunters was ambushed by Rogue pilots just south of the Kenai fields yesterday as they completed a circuit of the area. Rogue patrols had been ghosting the three novice Hunters for about a week as they searched the system to collect bounties on Rogue scalps. Yesterday the trap was laid and sprung. A force of seven Rogues destroyed all three Bounty Hunter ships. The action is an example of the organization and teamwork that Rogues have been attempting to instill within the membership lately.

Lane Hacker Information Pays Off

56435
NAME
MONTEZUMA — The intelligence purchased from Lane Hackers has more than paid for itself within the past several months in Cortez. Looted Luxury Good shipments from New York have been earning the majority of the money at the base. Once the cargo is acquired, Rogue smugglers make their way back to New York, where the goods are fenced to the Junkers at excellent prices. Unfortunately, this lucrative cycle may be nearing its end since the Luxury Goods shipments are entering the system with more and more escorts. Soon they will not be worth the price paid in pilots and ships.

56436
NAME
Fight Like the Outcasts

56437
NAME
MONTEZUMA — Rogue leaders aboard Dawson are attempting to convince Outcast smugglers on their way into Liberty space to train our own pilots. This initiative was created at the Rogue Chief meetings held in California recently. If the Outcasts are willing to share their knowledge of combat, gunnery, and piloting in return for favors and money, Rogue combat effectiveness should skyrocket. As of yet, no Outcasts have been willing, but leaders remain optimistic that an arrangement can be made.

NAME
Rogues Suffer a Loss to Kusari

56439
NAME
RAIDEN CLOUD — High-value Kusari goods will be entering Liberty soon, despite efforts by pilots from Padua. Rogues attempted to waylay an armored transport in the Trade Lanes just west of the Raiden Cloud. The ship’s defenses and escorts proved to be too much for the outgunned Rogue force, and after the loss of three of our men and their ships, the remaining members of the raiding party broke off the attack and limped back home. This is discouraging news, but we will come back from this experience stronger than ever.

56440
NAME
Close Call with Liberty Military

56441
NAME
PADUA — Two Rogues are recovering from injuries tonight in Padua after an encounter with a military patrol almost cost them their lives. The two were transporting Artifacts on behalf of the Outcasts when they were jumped by two military flights running a circuit from Colorado. The smugglers were caught at their most vulnerable point: halfway between the Komatsu and the Reppu Clouds. Luckily, the pilots were able to make it to the Reppu Cloud and escape, although their ships were badly damaged. They also managed to save the Artifacts, which will be smuggled into New York next week.

Food Shortages a Thing of the Past

56443
NAME
CRETE — The Family Elders of Crete are discussing plans regarding the construction of biodomes. If successful, Corsairs would never have to worry about the Food shortages that have plagued our people for the 800 years since we were cast upon Crete. In recent years, famine has not been a major issue for the Corsairs due to the wealth brought in from the Artifact trade and piracy. But the problem would be completely alleviated with the addition of biodomes, which could sustain the entire population for a fraction of the price now required.

56444
NAME
The Bounty Hunter Scourge

56445
NAME
CRETE — Many Corsairs believe that it is no longer necessary to tolerate the Zoner presence in Omicron Gamma’s sister system. There is concern that they allow Bounty Hunters to come too close to the homeworld. It has also been argued that the biodomes in Freeport 9 could be salvaged after the Zoner expulsion and used to grow food solely for Corsairs. Right now, the Zoners enjoy relative safety in Omicron Theta, but that could soon change.

56446
NAME
Rivera Returns from Sigma-19

56447
NAME
CRETE — Elder Rivera has returned from his negotiations with the Hogosha in Hawaii. The GMG will no longer be included in the sale of any Artifacts to the Kusari crime syndicate, which means more profits for the Corsairs. Toruella also finalized several other contracts with the Hogosha in preparation for the upcoming months. “I am pleased to announce that everything has gone as planned,” Rivera admitted upon his arrival back in Corsair space. “The Hogosha will back us completely for direct access to our Artifacts.”

56448

New Advances in Ship Technology

56449
NAME
TRIPOLI — Centuries of reverse engineering and building fighter crafts from the remnants of salvaged ships have paid off yet again. Tripoli engineers discovered a new way to fine-tune the H-Fuel intake components on a star drive, yielding much greater power than the original Kishiro designers thought possible. This latest discovery will allow any Corsair ship with the same engine to increase its speed by at least 50 percent after stabilizers are added to the ship’s hull and engine mountings.

56450
NAME
Troops Pulled from the Front

56451
NAME
CADIZ — Soldiers and pilots are being rotated back to Crete from the front in the following weeks. A full squadron of fighters and a company of marines will maintain a holding presence in Cadiz, but the rest are headed back for new orders. Most of the pilots headed back to Omicron Gamma are glad to be getting out of the system, but the generals have alerted the men and women remaining at Cadiz that they will assume a defensive position against the Hessians for several months, a move that should significantly reduce casualties.

56452
NAME
Every Corsair’s Duty

56453
NAME
LEON — The Elders wish to remind the Corsairs of Leon that they must continue with raids upon Bretonia, concentrating specifically upon the Gold shipments in Dublin and New London. “Men and women of Leon, though you are not currently serving at military grade, you must strive to make sure that the body of our nation remains fed and armed. I task you, my children, to go out into the stars and bring back their fire,” commands the High Elder Montoya. Keep the supplies coming in from Bretonia.

NAME
The Road To Rheinland Part I

56455
NAME
CRETE — The war of attrition in Omega-5 is costing us too many lives and ships in a fruitless struggle to gain control of the southern Border Worlds. The Elders have decided upon a new strategy to destroy the Red Hessians once and for all. Forces from Cadiz will be redeployed to Crete, where they will rearm and prepare for a northern assault into Rheinland. Once this is done the new Northern Fleet will move up to Sigma-19, and after we are in position, we shall commence an attack on the Junkers in Sigma-13.

56456
NAME
The Road To Rheinland Part II

56457
NAME
CRETE — The Hogosha has agreed to use their contacts in Kusari to put focused pressure upon the Outcasts, alleviating the possibility of a flank attack by our northern enemies. In return, the Hogosha will be given exclusive Artifacts-distribution rights for all of Sirius. The Junkers at Sigma-13 cannot withstand a focused attack and will fall. The Northern Fleet will then invade Frankfurt, where we should encounter minimal resistance from the Bundschuh or the Rheinland Federal Police. As soon as Frankfurt falls, a base of operations will be established there and lines drawn for the push into Dresden.

56458
NAME
The Road To Rheinland Part III

56459
NAME
CRETE — The Northern Fleet in Frankfurt will stage an all-out attack on the Red Hessians in Dresden. Once Hessian forces are pulled from Omega-11 and Omega-5 to counter the Northern Fleet’s assault, conscripted forces from Leon and the standing fleet in Cadiz will launch into the two weakened Omega systems. When victory is achieved in the Omegas, the Leon fleet will attack the Hessians in Dresden from behind, and the hammer will meet the anvil. The Cadiz Fleet will stand by to reinforce and protect the flank.

Don Teofilo Dies of Natural Causes

56461
NAME
MALTA — One of the oldest and most respected cartel dons has passed away at the age of 177. Teofilo Wenceslau died in his sleep at his plantation yesterday surrounded by his closest family members. Wenceslau was the oldest man in Outcast history, having outlived the next eldest by twelve years. Though the Cardamine mutation has lowered birth rates among our race, a positive effect has been the dramatic increase in the average lifespan, which is currently 124. Teofilo is survived by his eldest daughter, Dona Alicia, who will now assume command of the Wenceslau cartel.

Benitez takes Control of Solano

56463
NAME
MALTA — Miguel Benitez rules the most powerful cartel in Outcast space after acquiring the Solano Plantation last month. The Toruella and Velez cartels have also pledged their loyalty to the Benitez family, in a surprise move that guarantees his ascension to Head Don of the Outcasts. Benitez’s primary rival, Don David of the Narvaez cartel, has decided not to oppose Benitez when he assumes leadership of the families of Malta.

NAME
Our Purgatory Becomes a Paradise

56465
NAME
MALTA — With the enormous influx of money into the Outcast economy, Malta is slowly being transformed into rolling fields of tall orange grasses and luxuriant towns and cities. Almost the entire population is involved in the Cardamine trade, and there is so much profit to make that even field hands are living in a style only those in the capital systems are accustomed to. Slowly, the Outcasts have built a paradise from the bitter soils and rocky crags of this planet.

IMG Base Location Still a Mystery

56467
NAME
MALTA — Interrogators did not have a chance to unlock any information regarding the location of the secret IMG base in Tau-37. The captured miner, who was traveling through the Edge Worlds towards the hidden base, died from injuries he sustained while trying to escape the Outcast patrol that caught him unawares. “It is a pity that he was so badly injured. We didn’t even get a chance to begin interrogating him before he died,” said security officer Jose Rubiera. Outcasts continue searching for the elusive miners.

56469
NAME
RUIZ — Yesterday Outcast patrols intercepted and destroyed a small GMG survey ship convoy that was launching retrievable probes into the alien organics fields northeast of the Jump Hole to Sigma-19. This is the fifth incursion into the system by the GMG in as five months. A reprisal attack against GMG operations in the Border Worlds was ordered and launched. Our fighters returned to base after destroying a mining ship and killing at least a dozen miners in the Hiryu Cloud.

Outcast Raiding Fleet to be Updated

56471

MALTA — Engineers are revamping 100 ships per month over the next two years to make the Raiders even more deadly than they already are. Master engineer Ibrahim Casse has developed a new design that will be implemented on the fleet. Casse’s 100+ years of experience as an engineer makes him the finest ship designer and builder in all of Sirius. His academy builds new prototypes every semester as he trains a new generation to follow in his footsteps.

Benitez Calls Upon all Outcasts

56473
NAME
MALTA — Don Miguel Benitez called upon Outcasts throughout Sirius to help him locate his missing son. Benitez even summoned Santiago Llorens, who was in Liberty conducting business. Llorens responded to the call by returning to Malta. Benitez’s third eldest son, who has been missing for some time, sent a distress call from the Sigma Border Worlds two days ago. “I ask that all Outcasts use their powers and talents to find my son, whose safe return will bring a six million credit reward,” offered Don Miguel.

Cardamine Profits Run Higher

56475
NAME
MALTA — Cartels across the planet are celebrating tonight after quarterly Cardamine profits were registered. “The criminals that distribute the Cardamine are accounting for a significant portion of total profits,” said Jorge Garcia, a profits estimator, “and the popularity that Cardamine is experiencing among the wealthiest citizens of the House systems is soaring.” With the introduction of Cardamine into Kusari — thanks to the efforts of the Golden Chrysanthemums — plantation growers are enjoying their highest profits ever recorded. Many believe that this is a critical transition point for Cardamine and project that a quarter of all Sirius will be addicted to the drug by the end of the decade.

56476
NAME
The Golden C. Is Addicted

56477
NAME
CALI — It appears that the Kusari terrorist organization, the Golden Chrysanthemums, has become completely dependent upon Cardamine. Outcast observers were able to ascertain that the Golden C. is even using the drug as part of several of their high-level ceremonies. “I believe that they will be even more obedient than the Liberty Rogues, given time,” said observer Javier Soto. The organization is perfect for distribution because it has its finger on the pulse of the Kusari youth.

Docking Ring

60208
NAME
A docking ring is a piece of orbiting technology that, through the use of super strong crystalline polymers and frictionless bearings, assists the smooth atmospheric entry of any interstellar vessel that can land. Invented in 130 AS by Ageira Technologies, these ‘orbital elevators’ almost completely negate the cost of boosting people or materials out of a planetary gravity well. Docking rings revolutionized exploration and industry almost overnight, opening up entire systems for commercial exploration and exploitation.\n\nAgeira Technologies licenses this technology to the other houses, who in turn agree to design all ships (except for special exploratory and survey vessels), to work with the docking ring system.\n\nWARNING: Do not approach a planet and attempt a landing without using the docking ring.

60209

Jump Gate

60210
NAME
A jump gate is a conveyance technology that allows instantaneous travel between two distinct points in space using technology pioneered by Ageira Technologies and built by Deep Space Engineering in 130 AS. According to the annual Ageira Technologies Shareholder Report, ‘jump gate technology is designed to gather and amplify certain permeable tendencies in real-space and connect them to other congruent points elsewhere in the sector, while still maintaining the structural integrity and stability of the channel created by this process and of the object passing through it.’\n\nAgeira Technologies and Deep Space Engineering continue to survey other potential jump point candidates and expect to provide connections with other areas further and further away as their research continues.

60211
NAME
Jump Hole

60212
NAME
***GRAVITATIONAL ANOMALY DETECTED***\nMagnetic and gravimetric readings consistent with a ‘jump hole’.\n\nLike jump gates, jump holes are semi-permeable areas in real space that tend to breach the natural boundaries of linear time and space. Unlike jump gates, though, these anomalies occur naturally and so are both unpredictable and unstable. Traveling through jump holes is a risky proposition at best. Though some have been charted and, based on accounts from ships that have accidentally encountered them, have had their exit points logged, just as many ships have never been heard from again. It is believed that these ships were either crushed in the violent, cataclysmic vortex that lies outside the narrow corridor of a jump tunnel, or were sent to a place far enough away to make communication or a return trip infeasible. In either case, those missing are presumed dead. Ageira Technologies and Deep Space Engineering urge all citizens to use the prescribed trade lanes and jump gates and to avoid all contact with jump holes.

Trade lanes are used for superluminal travel within a system. Trade lanes must be entered from their origin point, usually located near key industrial, military, or civilian bases.\n\nThe first trade lane was established through a joint venture between Deep Space Engineering and Ageira Technologies in the year 280 AS. By 350 AS, most of Liberty space was crisscrossed by trade lanes. Through financing from Interspace Commerce, the trade lane network was rapidly extended into the other colonies, helping to create a truly sector-wide economy. Trade lanes are the fastest and safest method of transporting goods and personnel within and between the colonies. Plans to expand the trade lanes to connect interests in the independent territories outside of the colonies are pending.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The history of the Unioners is intimately tied to Alster. The shipyard opened in 412 AS, specializing in commercial transports and heavy lifters.

Coupled with the excessively long spaceside rotations, the workers’ morale gradually deteriorated until a major accident killed several hundred workers in 512 AS.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Three months later, the workers formed the Alster Union.

In a bloody coup during the celebration of the revived Sakura festival in 321 AS, the Shogun was surrounded in the palace by Samura-backed elements of the military and asked to surrender, along with the Royal Guard. The Shogun, humiliated by the shame he had brought his family, committed suicide. The guards, headed by Kozue Okamura, did not acquiesce so easily. In a bloody battle, they fought their way out of the palace and retreated into the darkness of northern Kusari space. Here they regrouped and began a long guerrilla campaign aimed at overthrowing the Samura-controlled Kusari government.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Blood Dragons are a tight group that holds the sympathy and support of individuals in the highest levels of the Kusari government.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>The story of the Hessians emerges from the turbulent history of the Dresden System, the mining heartland of Rheinland since the beginning of the third century. Mining there was dirty, dangerous work, but Daumann and Kruger had little reason to lose sleep over the welfare of their employees. The price of the occasional disability pension or life insurance policy was nothing compared to the money made from extracting and refining the metals and materials that fed the Rheinland industry.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>As the Eighty Years’ War wound down to its ignoble conclusion, Rheinland found itself virtually bankrupt. Kruger and Daumann released thousands of employees throughout Rheinland. Promises of bonuses were left unfulfilled, and in many cases, miners were left completely destitute. An uprising was almost inevitable. A group of miners took control of the Daumann Heavy Construction facility on Von Rohe’s Day in 700 AS.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The revolt soon spread from Dresden to the rest of the Rheinland, gaining widespread backing from the legions of newly unemployed workers. The industrial heart of Rheinland stopped beating; the Popular Revolution had begun.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Within five months a new coalition government was established. Both Kruger and Daumann were required to pay reparations, and all Rheinland companies were forced to comply with a newly ratified Workers’ Rights Convention. They have been careful to adhere to the letter of the law, if not the spirit. The compromise left many that had fought in the revolution bitter. Many workers could not accept the prospect of working for their old taskmasters and decided to form the Red Hessians, a group dedicated to destroying the two companies.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>It was not long before Red Hessian political ideals were replaced by greed, which has led them to become more like pirates than activists. The police have been forced to maintain a significant presence in Dresden to prevent Hessian strikes from clogging the gears of the Rheinland industry.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Hessians have gradually expanded, assisted by their close proximity to Stuttgart Food shipments and an extensive Jump Hole network within the southern Sirius Sector. They now own a string of bases in the southern Rheinland Border Worlds. In Omega-5 they encountered their first real obstacle — the Corsairs. They have fought the Edge World faction to a tenuous stalemate, with the Ronneburg base barely holding on against the stronger Corsair presence in that system.

During the Dresden rebellion of 700 AS, the Bundschuh found their first official cause — shipping supplies “liberated” from Frankfurt to the Kruger and Daumann rebels. Three months after that, sympathetic maintenance workers started sabotaging Daumann’s manufacturing operations in New Berlin. The industrial heart of Rheinland stopped beating, and the Popular Revolution had begun.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Five years later the Emperor was overthrown, and a new coalition government was established in its place. While the Bundschuh initially pushed for a full investigation into the activities of companies such as Kruger Minerals and Daumann Heavy Construction, more pragmatic elements within the government decided that for the newly formed Rheinland Republic to succeed, it needed the support of the aristocrats who controlled those and other major companies. Both Kruger and Daumann were eventually required to pay substantial reparations intended to “improve the Rheinland Republic for the good of all people,” and all Rheinland companies were forced to comply with a newly ratified Workers’ Rights Convention.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>By 715 AS business in Dresden had more or less resumed as usual. The Bundschuh was driven underground, an impractical brand of idealism ill-suited to building a consensus among the many different government factions and the aristocrats who controlled the purse strings.

As part of an effort to stimulate rice production on Kyushu, Samura gradually organized the Kyushu farmers into cooperatives that would buy Fertilizer and customized seeds from their laboratories in New Tokyo. Consumers paid exorbitant amounts for the rice produced, which everyone swore was much higher quality than that produced in any other part of Kusari, and thus worth the premium price it fetched in Samura’s New Tokyo supermarkets.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>With the eventual introduction of Trade Lanes, Kusari farmers were opened to competition with the rest of the Sirius Sector. They lobbied the government heavily, financed with Samura money, which had the most to lose from cheaper foreign competitors. The government acquiesced for several centuries, leading to astronomical Kusari Food prices. Eventually, under pressure from the Liberty government, Kusari reopened the agricultural imports market, despite intense lobbying by Samura.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Synth Foods moved in and became an overnight success, opening franchises in the urban areas of Honshu and New Tokyo. Demand for expensive Kyushu Food dropped, and many independent farmers were forced out of business. Feeling betrayed, some of the farmers proceeded to organize the Farmers Alliance, a militant group that lobbies for “farmers’ rights” — which include such things as government subsidies and restrictions on the sale of foreign foods in Kusari. In fact, the Farmers Alliance generally is opposed to foreign influence of any kind, particularly the Trade Lanes that have so damaged their livelihoods.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The general population ignores the Farmers Alliance for the most part, though they do have some support among older Kusari citizens. In reality, The Farmers Alliance is little more than a puppet of Samura, who wishes to return to its Food and trade monopoly days. Samura uses them for much of its dirty work, attacking foreign shippers, Synth Foods, and even Kishiro on occasion. The Farmers Alliance likes the Hogosha, as they represent the traditional “criminals” of Kusari that fit in with society. They abhor the Golden Chrysanthemums and their disgusting drug habit.

Either they work in the factories of Houston for a pittance, join the Bounty Hunters and hunt down their former brethren, go radical and hook up with the Xenos, or rejoin their former partners in crime. The latter path is the obvious one for most. Simply put, these are not-too-quick opportunists, people willing to do whatever it takes to make a buck and get by until tomorrow. Usually, they end up taking the fall for anything illegal that occurs in Liberty, whether they were involved or not.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Rogues are generally a disorganized lot. They are responsible for most of the Trade Lane attacks in Liberty space and the adjacent Independent Worlds, usually operating in groups of only two or three ships, without much grasp of advanced tactics. They also provide shelter for the Outcasts in exchange for Cardamine. Recently they have become the smugglers for much of the Cardamine in Liberty space, supplementing or even replacing the Outcasts on certain high-risk routes. This has made them accomplices to the most persecuted criminal group in Liberty space. They admire the Outcasts, wishing they could be as smart and careful as the Edge World faction. But they regard the LPI as their ultimate masters, perhaps aware that soon they will probably be under the LPI’s thumb once again.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The primary Rogue base is Buffalo, deep within the confines of the Badlands of New York. Secondary bases are in the Whitney Asteroid Field in California, the Reppu Cloud in Galileo, the Corcovado Field in Cortez, and the Wrangell Field in Hudson.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Where there’s junk, there are the Junkers. They’ve been around since the earliest days of the Trade Lanes. Descended from the working classes, they developed within the House systems as a sort of necessary evil, handling the dirty work that no one else would. They do well salvaging valuable materials from the ever-increasing debris fields throughout Sirius, with the notable exception of Kusari. To this day they remain held at bay by the Hogosha.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Anyone who deals with Junkers knows they live by a strict code; if you’re not a Junker, you’re not part of the family. A Junker will double-cross you without a second thought, and they’re fiercely protective of each other. Most House corporations consider the Junkers to be simple criminals, but Junkers will occasionally do favors for the police, turning in the odd, mid-level criminal or letting them know about the occasional drug shipment. So despite some harassment, the police stop short of shutting them down. The infrequent police cleanup operations are little more than exercises in public relations, though there’s no love lost between the two groups.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>The Junkers make their official money from salvaging debris within the fields, but also have a good deal going with various criminals, who like their “no questions asked” policy. Tolerated by the governments, Junkers sometimes deal in contraband, but they are extremely hard to catch red-handed. They are frequently patronized by the criminal element for the refuge they offer within the often hostile territory of House capital systems.</TEXT><PARA/><PARA/><TEXT>Liberty has two groups: a major population in the New York System, and a smaller enclave in Texas. The Junker base of operations in New London is located near the shipyards within the Southampton Debris Field. In New Berlin, they scavenge the remaining pockets of industrial waste and scrap within the asteroid fields. Their latest foray is a departure — a base in the Border Worlds. Attracted by the ALG operation in Sigma-13, they have set up shop near the facility and do most of the dirty work, picking off the best loot from the old ships for themselves. It also serves as a convenient launching point for Cardamine and Artifact runs into New Berlin. Long-distance smuggling is new for the faction, which is still perfecting this skill.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

Deshima Station was constructed in 350 AS to house this population, and despite the significant relaxation of New Tokyo System entry requirements, it still serves as a way station. Over the years Deshima has been substantially improved through the addition of a Synth Foods biodome, the construction of additional living space, and a partnership with Kishiro to manufacture Consumer Goods. The Bounty Hunters Guild also recently opened an office here as the large numbers of foreigners in the system include a significant criminal element.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

NAME
We’ve been keeping a close watch on %F0v1 recently. 

327782
NAME
We’ve been keeping a close watch on %F0v1 recently. 

327783
NAME
Our most recent scans of %Z0v1 uncovered something very interesting. 

327784
NAME
We found %I0v1 and %I1v1 in a previously empty area. Your mission is to mount a quick surgical strike to remove this new threat. 

327785
NAME
Surveillance indicates that %F0v1 is up to something. 

327786
NAME
Surveillance indicates that %F0v1 are up to something. 

327787
NAME
Our analysts have scanned %Z0v1 and have found something suspicious. 

327788
NAME
We believe they are building what appears to be %I0v1 there. We can’t allow that to continue. Your mission is to fly there and put a stop to their operation. 

327789
NAME
Our scouts have informed us that more territory has fallen under the influence of %F0v1. 

327790
NAME
Our scouts have informed us that more territory has fallen under the influence of %F0v1. 

327791
NAME
A new base of theirs has recently been spotted in %Z0v1. We want it removed. 

327792
NAME
Your mission is to make your way to that area and eliminate %I0v2 you will find there. Understand, your primary objective is their installation, not %I1v2. 

327793
NAME
Recon has discovered a small installation run by %F0v1. 

327794
NAME
Recon has discovered a small installation run by %F0v1. 

327795
NAME
Currently, it consists of %I0v1. 

327796
NAME
Despite its significance, this is far too minor a target for us to trifle with. However, we are looking for a third party willing to travel to %Z0v1 to deal with this problem for us. 

327797
NAME
Upon successful destruction of all targets, we will compensate this third party with %d0 credits. 

327798
NAME
One more thing, we also want you to eliminate all %F0v2 ships you encounter on your mission. 

327799
NAME
It is entirely your option to eliminate whatever hostile contacts you may encounter. Even if you do not, your compensation is assured with the completion of your main objective. 

327800
NAME
A more detailed scan hasn’t revealed any %F0v2 ships near their installation, so this may be a clean go. 

327801
NAME
We have already dispatched a wing of ships to %Z0v1. Meet up with them and they will assist you. 

327802
NAME
Once you’ve engaged %F0v1, we will send in other units for support. 

327803
NAME
Be advised that we can’t spare any other pilots to help you, so this will be a solo mission. 

327804
NAME
We have tracked down the wanted criminal, %s0 %s1. 

327805
NAME
This menace’s last known location was in %Z0v1. 

327806
NAME
Find him, destroy his ship, and tractor in his %L0v1. 

327807
NAME
Once it’s secured in your cargo hold, bring it back to %B so we can deal with him appropriately. 

327808
NAME
It appears there’s been a lot of activity from %F0v1 lately. 

327809
NAME
It appears there’s been a lot of activity from %F0v1 lately. 

327810
NAME
We’ve singled out one of their operatives, %s0 %s1. 

327811
NAME
It appears he is transporting %L0v2 in his ship. We are willing to pay to have him intercepted. 

327812
NAME
You are directed to destroy his ship and tractor in %L0v3. 

327813
NAME
We have reports that our old friend %s0 %s1 is up to some new tricks. 

327814
NAME
His ties to %F0v1 are apparently as strong as ever. 

327815
NAME
His ties to %F0v1 are apparently as strong as ever. 

327816
NAME
He recently acquired %L0v2 from an unnamed source. This is unacceptable to us. 

327817
NAME
Your mission is to find him and destroy %L0v3 at all costs. 

327818
NAME
We have tolerated %F0v1 long enough. 

327819
NAME
We have tolerated %F0v1 long enough. 

327820
NAME
One of their more active leaders, %s0 %s1, has been spotted. 

327821
NAME
He was last seen in %Z0v1 and we have reason to believe he’s still there. 

327822
NAME
You are hereby authorized to track him down and assassinate him. With his termination, perhaps they will learn some respect for %F0v1. 

327823
NAME
You are hereby authorized to track him down and assassinate him. With his termination, perhaps they will learn some respect for %F0v1. 

327824
NAME
Move cautiously however, we believe that %I0v1 may be operating in the area. 

327825
NAME
A group of %F0v2 ships has been spotted. 

327826
NAME
A group of %F0v2 ships has been spotted. 

327827
NAME
We think they’re still in %Z0v1 where they were last seen. This is a simple housecleaning mission; get out there and make the area safe again. 

327828
NAME
We also understand that in addition to these ships there may be %I0v1 operating nearby. 

327829
NAME
In advance of your accepting this mission, we took the liberty of sending out some people to get the ball rolling. 

327830
NAME
In any case, once you’ve made it out there you will be joined by some of our ships, who will then act as your support. 

327831
NAME
We will dispatch a wing of our ships to %Z0v1 to assist you as soon as we can. Until then you will be solo on this one. 

327832
NAME
We’re being pressured by attacks from %F0v1. 

327833
NAME
We’re being pressured by attacks from %F0v1. 

327834
NAME
Our own sources have found they are attacking from %I0v1 and %I1v1. 

327835
NAME
Your job is to fly out to %Z0v1 and take them out — completely. 

327836
NAME
It appears %F0v1 has been very busy lately. 

327837
NAME
It appears %F0v1 have been very busy lately. 

327838
NAME
We’ve discovered that they’re building %I0v1. 

327839
NAME
We cannot afford for this to reach completion. Please fly to %Z0v1 and take care of this matter discreetly. 

327840
NAME
We’ve been informed that %F0v1 has just built a new installation. 

327841
NAME
We’ve been informed that the %F0v1 have just built a new installation. 

327842
NAME
This move in %Z0v1 now threatens our interests. 

327843
NAME
We want you to fly out there and destroy %I0v2. However, do not concern yourself with %I1v2, that is merely an obstacle. Your main goal is their base. 

327844
NAME
We have discovered a new %F0v2 presence. 

327845
NAME
We have discovered a new %F0v2 presence. 

327846
NAME
They have set up a new base in %Z0v1. 

327847
NAME
This is of some concern, but rather than undertake an expensive operation just to remove %I0v1, we are looking for a third party to help our cause. 

327848
NAME
We are offering %d0 credits for its removal. 

327849
NAME
Needless to say, we would also want you to terminate any and all %F0v2 ships you may come in contact with. 

327850
NAME
Naturally, you may eliminate any hostiles you may encounter in the service of your mission. However, don’t be concerned if you stay expressly to task, since you’ll be paid just the same. 

327851
NAME
Scans reveal an astonishing absence of %F0v2 ships near their base. This is odd, so proceed with caution. However, you may also be catching them at a weak moment. 

327852
NAME
A group of our ships is already on the way to %Z0v1 to help out. Link up with them and they’ll be your backup. 

327853
NAME
Once you have engaged %F0v1, we’ll send in some ships to act as backup. 

327854
NAME
Understand that we do not have the resources to call in anyone else to help you out, so you’ll be working alone. 

327855
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a renegade and must be stopped. 

327856
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a renegade and must be stopped. 

327857
NAME
He has been spotted in %Z0v1. 

327858
NAME
You are to track him down, destroy his ship, and tractor in his %L0v1. 

327859
NAME
Then, deliver it back to %B, so we may give him what’s coming to him. 

327860
NAME
We’ve just received an update regarding %s0 %s1. 

327861
NAME
He’s just gotten into a ship carrying %L0v2. 

327862
NAME
We see this as a golden opportunity to get back at %F0v1. 

327863
NAME
We see this as a golden opportunity to get back at %F0v1. 

327864
NAME
We would like you to track him down, eliminate him and pick up %L0v3. 

327865
NAME
We understand that %F0v1 has hired a new operative to do some of their dirty work. 

327866
NAME
We understand that %F0v1 have hired an operative to do some of their dirty work. 

327867
NAME
%s0 %s1 is his name, and he’s good. 

327868
NAME
He was sent to acquire %L0v2, which he has done. Now the goods are on him, and he’s on his way to the drop. It’s the perfect time to strike. 

327869
NAME
You are to track him down and eliminate all evidence of %L0v3. 

327870
NAME
%s0 %s1, one of our more troublesome enemies, has just been spotted. 

327871
NAME
At the time of this sighting, he was just entering %Z0v1. We would like you to follow him and assassinate him quickly and quietly. 

327872
NAME
We want his death to linger in the minds of %F0v1. 

327873
NAME
We want his death to linger in the minds of %F0v1. 

327874
NAME
Be aware though, we think that %I0v1 may also be in the area where he was last seen. 

327875
NAME
We understand some %F0v2 ships have been causing a lot of trouble. We can’t allow that to continue. 

327876
NAME
We understand some %F0v2 ships have been causing a lot of trouble. We can’t allow that to continue. 

327877
NAME
Please fly out to %Z0v1 and rid us of those pests. 

327878
NAME
We aren’t sure, but there may also be %I0v1 out there as well, so be prepared. 

327879
NAME
To make your job easier, we sent out a few of our own people to prepare for your arrival. 

327880
NAME
We thought you could use some help, so once you get out there a group of %F0v2 ships will be dispatched to hook up with you. 

327881
NAME
Our ships will join you in %Z0v1 to act as backup. However, until they arrive you are on your own. 

327882
NAME
It’s clear %F0v1 has gone too far this time. 

327883
NAME
It’s clear %F0v1 have gone too far this time. 

327884
NAME
We’ve just identified %I0v1 and %I1v1 of theirs dangerously close to our own interests. 

327885
NAME
Your job is to go to %Z0v1 and to terminate that base at once. 

327886
NAME
Underground sources say that %F0v1 is finishing construction on a new base. 

327887
NAME
Underground sources say that %F0v1 are finishing construction on a new base. 

327888
NAME
We think they’re working on %I0v1. 

327889
NAME
We would like you to travel to %Z0v1 and prevent this from succeeding. Do whatever you have to. 

327890
NAME
We have noticed that %F0v1 is trying to increase their territory. It’s a feeble attempt. 

327891
NAME
We have noticed that %F0v1 are trying to increase their territory. It’s a feeble attempt. 

327892
NAME
Regardless, you are to fly to %Z0v1 and destroy their base. 

327893
NAME
Be sure to take out %I0v2. However, leave %I1v2 intact to serve as a painful reminder. 

327894
NAME
Between us, a new base belonging to %F0v1 has been sighted. 

327895
NAME
Between us, a new base belonging to %F0v1 has been sighted. 

327896
NAME
They only have %I0v1, but still, it can’t be tolerated. 

327897
NAME
The deal is: We are willing to shell out %d0 credits for its removal by a third party. 

327898
NAME
We suggest you take it. Fly out to %Z0v1 and get to work. 

327899
NAME
We do, of course, want you to kill all %F0v2 ships in that area, just to be sure. 

327900
NAME
Of course, we wouldn’t deprive you of additional kills. However, if you’re clever you’ll realize that you’re just being paid for this one sanction, not the collateral damage. Why waste your talents? 

327901
NAME
A scan of the area reveals a noticeable absence of %F0v2 ships around your target. Fools. They’ll never know what hit ’em. 

327902
NAME
We have already sent a few of our ships to %Z0v1. Rendezvous with them and they will help you accomplish your task. 

327903
NAME
Once you have engaged %F0v1, we will send in other ships to cover you. 

327904
NAME
Bear in mind that we will not be sending anyone else in to assist you. You will be operating on your own, so don’t do anything stupid. 

327905
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a wanted man and has just been ratted out. 

327906
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a wanted man and has just been ratted out. 

327907
NAME
One of his associates has informed us that he’s in %Z0v1. 

327908
NAME
We want you to track him down and smash his ship but salvage his %L0v1. 

327909
NAME
That way when you bring him back to %B, we will have something alive to start with when we exact retribution. 

327910
NAME
I am pleased to report that %F0v1 has finally made a critical mistake. 

327911
NAME
I am pleased to report that %F0v1 have finally made a critical mistake. 

327912
NAME
It appears that one of their number, %s0 %s1, has just been seen boarding a ship to move %L0v2. 

327913
NAME
At its last sighting, this ship was headed to %Z0v1. 

327914
NAME
We want you to find him, kill him, and pick up %L0v3 while you’re at it. 

327915
NAME
It seems %F0v1 has recently acquired something it shouldn’t have. 

327916
NAME
It seems %F0v1 have recently acquired something they shouldn’t have. 

327917
NAME
Apparently, %L0v2 fell into their hands. 

327918
NAME
More specifically, into %s0 %s1’s hands. 

327919
NAME
Too bad for him. We want you to find him, follow him, and then kill him. Destroy %L0v3 right then and there. We can’t afford to let that kind of cargo fall into enemy hands. 

327920
NAME
%F0v3 has been a thorn in our side for far too long. 

327921
NAME
%F0v3 have been a thorn in our side for far too long. 

327922
NAME
We’ve decided to make an example of one of their leaders, and we’ve chosen %s0 %s1. 

327923
NAME
He’s been tracked down to %Z0v1. 

327924
NAME
Fly out there and show him, and everyone else, what happens to people who cross %F0v1. 

327925
NAME
Fly out there and show him, and everyone else, what happens to people who cross %F0v1. 

327926
NAME
One final note, there is the possibility that your target has %I0v1 in the area. Move carefully. 

327927
NAME
A word from %Z0v1 is that there is a new infestation of scum out there. 

327928
NAME
This time it’s %F0v1. Time to call the exterminator, and that’s you. 

327929
NAME
This time it’s %F0v1. Time to call the exterminator, and that’s you. 

327930
NAME
Watch yourself though, there may also be %I0v1 operating out there as well. 

327931
NAME
In any case, we’ve already sent out some of our agents to act as your support on this mission. 

327932
NAME
So once you’re out there, a group of our ships will meet up with you and act as your cover. 

327933
NAME
We realize you may need some backup. However, until we can send a group of our ships to run interference for you in %Z0v1, you’ll be on your own out there. 

327934
NAME
Based on intelligence reports, we’ve been monitoring %F0v1 very closely lately. 

327935
NAME
Based on intelligence reports, we’ve been monitoring %F0v1 very closely lately. 

327936
NAME
Thanks to these efforts, we’ve noticed a lot of recent activity in %Z0v1. 

327937
NAME
Recon has identified %I0v1 and %I1v1 in this area. We cannot afford to let this group continue to expand its influence there. We want you to cut them down to size. 

327938
NAME
It’s no surprise that we’ve been having trouble with %F0v1, now more than ever. 

327939
NAME
It’s no surprise that we’ve been having trouble with %F0v1, now more than ever. 

327940
NAME
It seems every time we relax our grasp it’s perceived as a weakness, and others try to take advantage of it. Now there’s a new situation in %Z0v1. 

327941
NAME
We’ve just discovered that this group has completed the construction of %I0v1 there. Our position is simple: Now that we’ve found it, we need to take it down. Your mission is to strike this target and destroy it completely. 

327942
NAME
We need to strike a blow to the continued expansion of %F0v1. Hit them where it hurts. 

327943
NAME
We need to strike a blow to the continued expansion of %F0v1. Hit them where it hurts. 

327944
NAME
Intelligence reports they have a new base in %Z0v1. This seems like the perfect target of opportunity for us. 

327945
NAME
Your mission objective is to fly there and destroy their installation. Repeat: Only destroy %I0v2. You will leave %I1v2 untouched for now. 

327946
NAME
We’ve just discovered that %F0v1 has a new presence. 

327947
NAME
We’ve just discovered that %F0v1 have a new presence. 

327948
NAME
It’s a minor presence, I’ll grant you — just %I0v1. 

327949
NAME
However, we do still need it dealt with — and fairly soon. We are willing to pay you to fly to %Z0v1 and take care of this matter for us personally. 

327950
NAME
Once you are successful, you will receive %d0 credits and will have done us a great service. 

327951
NAME
As a side note, you are to engage all %F0v2 ships that you may encounter along the way. 

327952
NAME
You are also hereby authorized to destroy any other %F0v2 ships in the course of your mission. However, this is your option — you will be paid regardless. 

327953
NAME
In addition, intelligence says there don’t appear to be any additional %F0v2 ships in the area, so you may be in luck. 

327954
NAME
Our ships will rendezvous with you on the way to %Z0v1. They will act as your support to help you complete your mission. 

327955
NAME
Once you engage %F0v1, we will dispatch a backup contingent of ships to act as your support should you need them. 

327956
NAME
You will be acting alone on this mission. Unfortunately, we can’t spare any other pilots to back you up, so be careful. 

327957
NAME
One of our informants has identified the whereabouts of %s0 %s1, one of our most wanted. 

327958
NAME
Our confidence is high that he is in %Z0v1. 

327959
NAME
We want you to track him down there, destroy his ship, and retrieve his %L0v1. 

327960
NAME
Once he is in your custody, head to %B. We will take it from there. 

327961
NAME
Intelligence has just published its new findings on %F0v1. 

327962
NAME
Intelligence has just published its new findings on %F0v1. 

327963
NAME
Based on our analysis of this data, we have identified one of their operatives, %s0 %s1, as a valuable target. 

327964
NAME
He is currently between destinations — exposed — moving %L0v2. We want him intercepted. 

327965
NAME
You are authorized to track him down, destroy his ship and tractor in %L0v3. 

327966
NAME
It appears that our old friend %s0 %s1 hasn’t learned his lesson. 

327967
NAME
His activities with %F0v1 have now become a larger problem for us. 

327968
NAME
His activities with %F0v1 have now become a problem for us. 

327969
NAME
It appears that he has somehow acquired %L0v2. The time has come for us to act. 

327970
NAME
You are directed to locate him and eliminate %L0v3 once and for all. 

327971
NAME
Our patience with %F0v1 has grown thin. We can’t tolerate their actions any longer. 

327972
NAME
Our patience with %F0v1 has grown thin. We can’t tolerate their actions any longer. 

327973
NAME
Our profilers have identified one of their operatives, %s0 %s1, as a viable target. 

327974
NAME
We believe him to be vulnerable, in %Z0v1, right now. 

327975
NAME
You have orders to terminate him with extreme prejudice. His execution will send a clear message from %F0v1. 

327976
NAME
You have orders to terminate him with extreme prejudice. His execution will send a clear message from %F0v1. 

327977
NAME
Use caution, though. We believe that %I0v1 may be in the same area as your target and could be a danger. 

327978
NAME
We have word that several %F0v2 ships have just been identified. 

327979
NAME
We have word that several %F0v2 ships have just been identified. 

327980
NAME
You are to fly to %Z0v1 and engage them at once. Eliminate all hostile ships. 

327981
NAME
As a side note, it is possible that %I0v1 may be operating nearby, so approach with caution. 

327982
NAME
Meanwhile, we already have advance ships in the area. Hook up with them once you are out there. 

327983
NAME
Meanwhile, once you’ve made it to your destination, you will be joined by our support units. They will help you complete your mission. 

327984
NAME
Meanwhile, given our situation in %Z0v1, there is every likelihood that you will be acting alone. Stay frosty out there. 

327985
NAME
We’re starting to feel the pressure from %F0v1. 

327986
NAME
We’re starting to feel the pressure from %F0v1. 

327987
NAME
We’ve only now just discovered the source of our trouble to be %I0v1 and %I1v1, from which they are staging their attacks. 

327988
NAME
We want you to make your way to %Z0v1 and bring this incident to a close. Take them down. 

327989
NAME
We understand %F0v1 has embarked on a new plan. 

327990
NAME
We understand %F0v1 have embarked on a new plan. 

327991
NAME
They intend to construct %I0v1 from which they hope to sustain more effective assaults on our interests. 

327992
NAME
We can’t allow this to happen. The time to act is now. Your mission is to head to %Z0v1 and take down their installation. 

327993
NAME
We understand that %F0v1 has just installed a new base of operations. 

327994
NAME
We understand that the %F0v1 have just installed a new base of operations. 

327995
NAME
Now our own interests in and around %Z0v1 appear to be at risk. 

327996
NAME
Please go there and close down their operation. We think you can ignore %I1v2. Concentrate your fire on %I0v2, which is our main concern. 

327997
NAME
A new %F0v2 presence has just recently been discovered. 

327998
NAME
A new %F0v2 presence has just recently been discovered. 

327999
NAME
Apparently, they’ve set up a new base of operations in %Z0v1. 

328000
NAME
This may not seem like a problem for us now — it’s just %I0v1, after all — but it might be soon. So rather than undertake the unnecessary risk of removal ourselves, we’d rather pay you to do it for us. 

328001
NAME
For this favor, we are offering you %d0 credits. 

328002
NAME
Of course, we would also want you to destroy any %F0v2 ships you encounter along the way. It’s neater that way. 

328003
NAME
Of course, you may also engage and destroy any hostiles you encounter along the way. Either way, it won’t impact our deal. 

328004
NAME
We have it on good authority that there are no %F0v2 ships near this installation right now. Excellent. This may be the right time to strike. 

328005
NAME
You’ll find that a group of our ships has already been sent to %Z0v1 to back you up. That should give you an edge. 

328006
NAME
You will engage %F0v1 first, then expect a group of our ships to act as backup — purely a precaution. 

328007
NAME
You understand, of course, that you’ll be working completely alone on this. There’ll be no one to call for backup. 

328008
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has caused us trouble for the last time. 

328009
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has caused us trouble for the last time. 

328010
NAME
He has just been seen in %Z0v1. We want him badly. 

328011
NAME
Please go after him and destroy his ship. Once you have done this, tractor in his %L0v1. 

328012
NAME
Then return to %B…. He will pay for his transgressions. 

328013
NAME
We have just received information on the whereabouts of %s0 %s1. 

328014
NAME
Apparently, he’s currently in a ship carrying %L0v2. Now he’s vulnerable. 

328015
NAME
This is the best time to strike a blow against %F0v1. 

328016
NAME
This is the best time to strike a blow against %F0v1. 

328017
NAME
We want you to hunt him down, eliminate him, and tractor in %L0v3. 

328018
NAME
We understand that %F0v1 has someone new working for them. 

328019
NAME
We understand that %F0v1 have someone new working for them. 

328020
NAME
%s0 %s1 has been identified as a major player in a series of crimes. 

328021
NAME
He has now stolen %L0v2 and is looking to offload them quickly to his handlers. 

328022
NAME
We want you to act as a cleaner, eliminating him and all traces of %L0v3. 

328023
NAME
%s0 %s1, one of the most dangerous operatives we know, has just been betrayed by a turncoat. 

328024
NAME
We are told that he is in %Z0v1. Your job is to make sure that he doesn’t see another day. Eliminate him. 

328025
NAME
Under a new initiative, this will be the first of many such moves against %F0v1. 

328026
NAME
Under a new initiative, this will be the first of many such moves against %F0v1. 

328027
NAME
Be advised, there may be %I0v1 at work in the area as well, so keep your eyes open. 

328028
NAME
We’ve been enduring one attack after another from %F0v1. Now we have had enough. 

328029
NAME
We’ve been enduring one attack after another from %F0v1. Now we have had enough. 

328030
NAME
Make your way to %Z0v1 and kill them. Kill them all. 

328031
NAME
Be advised that %I0v1 may be operating out there as well, so be cautious. 

328032
NAME
To help you accomplish your task, we have already dispatched some ships to assist you. 

328033
NAME
To help you accomplish your task, a group of %F0v2 ships will be dispatched once you reach your destination. 

328034
NAME
Our ships will rendezvous with you in %Z0v1 to be your support, but until they get there, you will be solo. 

328035
NAME
The actions of %F0v1 can no longer be tolerated. 

328036
NAME
The actions of %F0v1 can no longer be tolerated. 

328037
NAME
Now we’ve discovered %I0v1 and %I1v1 of theirs, in a very sensitive area. 

328038
NAME
We want you to go to %Z0v1 and destroy this operation once and for all. 

328039
NAME
Our informants say that %F0v1 is about to activate a new installation of some sort. 

328040
NAME
Our informants say that %F0v1 are about to activate a new installation of some sort. 

328041
NAME
We believe this installation is %I0v1. This could spell trouble for us. 

328042
NAME
We want you to go to %Z0v1 and prevent this from happening. Destroy everything. 

328043
NAME
We’ve noticed that %F0v1 is sadly trying to increase its influence. 

328044
NAME
We’ve noticed that %F0v1 are sadly trying to increase their influence. 

328045
NAME
Your mission is to fly to %Z0v1 and destroy this attempt. 

328046
NAME
We want you to eliminate %I0v2. However, leave %I1v2 to remind them of their mistake. 

328047
NAME
Our sources have identified a new base belonging to %F0v1. 

328048
NAME
Our sources have identified a new base belonging to %F0v1. 

328049
NAME
There’s not much to it. They only have %I0v1. Still, we cannot afford to be lenient. 

328050
NAME
We think we can pay you %d0 credits for the removal of this irritation. 

328051
NAME
It’s a generous rate, so you should accept the work. Once you do, get right on it and head for %Z0v1. Don’t fail us. 

328052
NAME
Naturally, we want you to kill all %F0v2 ships in the area, just to be thorough. 

328053
NAME
You can kill what you like out there, but we’re only paying you for your actual work. 

328054
NAME
To our knowledge, there are no %F0v2 ships around your target. Great. Now’s your chance. 

328055
NAME
Rendezvous with our ships in %Z0v1. They will help you accomplish your mission. 

328056
NAME
Once you’ve drawn first blood from %F0v1, we’ll send in additional ships to cover you. 

328057
NAME
You should realize that it’s just you out there; there’s no one else coming. If you die or fail, that’s it. 

328058
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is owed some payback. 

328059
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is owed some payback. 

328060
NAME
One of his men has told us that he is in %Z0v1 now. 

328061
NAME
We want you to get on his trail and take him out, but then scoop up his %L0v1. 

328062
NAME
Then we want you to make your way back to %B, so vengeance can be properly satisfied. 

328063
NAME
It seems %F0v1 has finally blundered. 

328064
NAME
It seems %F0v1 have finally blundered. 

328065
NAME
One of their men, %s0 %s1, has just boarded a ship to shift %L0v2. 

328066
NAME
Now’s our chance. The ship is heading into %Z0v1 — and our trap. 

328067
NAME
We want you to find him, kill him, and snag %L0v3 to boot. 

328068
NAME
So, %F0v1 has now done something new. 

328069
NAME
So, %F0v1 have now done something new. 

328070
NAME
Apparently, they’ve managed to snag %L0v2. 

328071
NAME
It’s clear, however, that %s0 %s1’s the mastermind behind this affront. 

328072
NAME
That makes him a very popular corpse in our book. Your mission is to acquire and then terminate him. Meanwhile, destroy %L0v3 while you’re at it, just to be on the safe side. 

328073
NAME
%F0v3 has been on our death list for a long time. 

328074
NAME
%F0v3 have been on our death list for a long time. 

328075
NAME
We’ve finally decided to assassinate one of their more visible leaders, %s0 %s1. 

328076
NAME
Fortunately, we’ve managed to locate him in %Z0v1. 

328077
NAME
We want you to go out there and give him a love letter from %F0v1 — one he won’t ever recover from. 

328078
NAME
We want you to go out there and give him a love letter from %F0v1 — one he won’t ever recover from. 

328079
NAME
One small detail: There is the chance that your target might be near %I0v1 in the area. Keep an eye out. 

328080
NAME
We’ve heard recently from %Z0v1, and there appears to be a problem out there. 

328081
NAME
It seems %F0v1 has overstepped its bounds. Time to teach them a lesson they won’t forget. 

328082
NAME
It seems %F0v1 have overstepped their bounds. Time to teach them a lesson they won’t forget. 

328083
NAME
However, be careful. There may also be %I0v1 operating out there as well. 

328084
NAME
In any case, we’ve already sent out some of our agents to serve as your backup. Hook up with them along the way. 

328085
NAME
In any case, a group of our ships will meet up with you once you arrive. They will act as your cover in this operation. 

328086
NAME
Unfortunately, we can only do so much right now. If you get into trouble in %Z0v1, you’re on your own out there. 

328087
NAME
Military Intelligence has had the movements of %F0v1 under close surveillance recently. 

328088
NAME
Military Intelligence has had the movements of %F0v1 under close surveillance recently. 

328089
NAME
We noticed increased comm. traffic and a jump in activity in %Z0v1, so we sent a recon team in to investigate. 

328090
NAME
They have reported that %I0v1 and %I1v1 have just come online in that area. Now we need you to go there and take down the installation. 

328091
NAME
Things have gone from bad to worse with %F0v1. 

328092
NAME
Things have gone from bad to worse with %F0v1. 

328093
NAME
Despite our best efforts, they have violated what little trust we had by building a new installation in %Z0v1. 

328094
NAME
The presence of %I0v1 out there changes everything. We can’t allow this kind of escalation. Therefore, your mission is to eliminate this problem for us. 

328095
NAME
We need to do something that will stop %F0v1 in its tracks. 

328096
NAME
We need to do something that will stop %F0v1 in their tracks. 

328097
NAME
We have identified one of their installations in %Z0v1 that should make a good target. 

328098
NAME
We want you to go there and take out that base. However, be sure to eliminate only %I0v2. We want you to leave %I1v2 alone to serve as a reminder to them. 

328099
NAME
Foolishly, %F0v1 has been making some minor attempts to move again. 

328100
NAME
Foolishly, %F0v1 have been making some minor attempts to move again. 

328101
NAME
We have just identified %I0v1 of theirs in a brand-new area. 

328102
NAME
This is a minor annoyance for us. However, we still can’t allow them to get a better foothold in that region. We are therefore willing to hire you to head to %Z0v1 and eliminate this nuisance for us. 

328103
NAME
Once you have completed this task, you will receive %d0 credits and our gratitude. Both are worth having, I assure you. 

328104
NAME
Naturally, we will also require you to destroy any %F0v2 ships that you may encounter along the way. 

328105
NAME
Naturally, feel free to destroy any other %F0v2 ships that you may encounter along the way. However, this is entirely up to you. 

328106
NAME
The area appears to be clear of any additional %F0v2 ships, so this may be a clean mission. Take advantage of it. 

328107
NAME
You will rendezvous with a support group of ships as you head to %Z0v1. Rely on them to help you complete your mission. 

328108
NAME
As you engage %F0v1, we will direct a support group of ships to meet you. Rely on them to help you complete your mission. 

328109
NAME
You will also be flying solo on this one, so don’t take any unnecessary risks. 

328110
NAME
After days of interrogation, one of our sources has finally told us where %s0 %s1 is. We’ve been after him for a long time…. 

328111
NAME
We are now fairly certain that he has been hiding out in %Z0v1. 

328112
NAME
Your mission is to track him down out there, destroy his ship, and recover his %L0v1. 

328113
NAME
Once you have custody, set your course for %B. We will take delivery there. 

328114
NAME
We’ve had our eye on %F0v1 for some time now. 

328115
NAME
We’ve had our eye on %F0v1 for some time now. 

328116
NAME
We think the time is right to take out one of their more senior operatives, %s0 %s1. 

328117
NAME
We understand that he is in transit right now, carrying %L0v2. We don’t want him to reach his destination. 

328118
NAME
You are to find and eliminate this target, then tractor in %L0v3. Be discreet and be accurate. We can’t afford to blow this. 

328119
NAME
We have a problem that requires some immediate attention, and its name is %s0 %s1. 

328120
NAME
He has been very busy lately with %F0v1. 

328121
NAME
He has been very busy lately with %F0v1. 

328122
NAME
Now that he’s acquired %L0v2, he’s become more trouble than he is worth. 

328123
NAME
Your mission is to locate this irritant and eliminate %L0v3 once and for all. 

328124
NAME
The time has come to move against %F0v1. 

328125
NAME
The time has come to move against %F0v1. 

328126
NAME
Intelligence has identified the whereabouts of one of their more high-profile members, %s0 %s1. 

328127
NAME
As near as we can tell, he is going to be in %Z0v1 shortly. This will provide the perfect opportunity for us to act. 

328128
NAME
Your mission is to hunt him down and execute him on the spot. They will learn to respect %F0v1. 

328129
NAME
Your mission is to hunt him down and execute him on the spot. They will learn to respect %F0v1. 

328130
NAME
However, we also understand that there may be %I0v1 operating in the area, so use caution. 

328131
NAME
A reconnaissance unit has reported that several %F0v2 ships have just been spotted. 

328132
NAME
A reconnaissance unit has reported that several %F0v2 ships have just been spotted. 

328133
NAME
We need you to fly to %Z0v1 and eliminate them all. 

328134
NAME
Be advised, there may also be %I0v1 operating in the area. 

328135
NAME
Meanwhile, some advanced ships have already been dispatched. They will be expecting you. 

328136
NAME
Meanwhile, support units will rendezvous with you once you’ve made it to your destination. Count on them to help you complete your mission. 

328137
NAME
Meanwhile, you will be operating completely alone out in %Z0v1. Do not fail us. 

328138
NAME
We’re getting a lot of heat from %F0v1 now. 

328139
NAME
We’re getting a lot of heat from %F0v1 now. 

328140
NAME
We just got word that they’ve been staging their assaults from %I0v1 and %I1v1. It’s time to take them out. 

328141
NAME
Go to %Z0v1 at once and clean house. Leave no trace. 

328142
NAME
We’ve just received some worrying news about %F0v1. 

328143
NAME
We’ve just received some worrying news about %F0v1. 

328144
NAME
We understand that they’re in the process of constructing %I0v1. 

328145
NAME
Naturally, we cannot allow this shift in the balance of power. We want you to fly to %Z0v1 and eliminate this problem before it gets out of control. 

328146
NAME
We now know that %F0v1 has just established a new base of operations. 

328147
NAME
We now know that %F0v1 have just established a new base of operations. 

328148
NAME
This raises grave concerns for us in %Z0v1. 

328149
NAME
We want you to fly out there and eliminate %I0v2. Don’t bother with %I1v2, focus only on your main objective. 

328150
NAME
We’ve just been informed of a new %F0v2 situation. 

328151
NAME
We’ve just been informed of a new %F0v2 situation. 

328152
NAME
They have apparently set up a new facility in %Z0v1. 

328153
NAME
This facility is minor, merely %I0v1. However just to be safe, we want you to dismantle this operation as soon as possible. 

328154
NAME
In return for this quick, discreet intervention, you will be paid %d0 credits. 

328155
NAME
Additionally, we want you to eliminate all %F0v2 ships you come in contact with. 

328156
NAME
Additionally, feel free to take on any other hostiles you run into along the way. You’ll be paid regardless. 

328157
NAME
There appear to be no %F0v2 ships in the area. That could be a good sign, so move quickly while you have the advantage. 

328158
NAME
We’ve already alerted a group of our ships to head to %Z0v1. They will rendezvous with you and serve as your backup. 

328159
NAME
Once you have engaged %F0v1, a group of our ships will arrive and serve as your backup. 

328160
NAME
Understand that under the circumstances, you’ll be on your own out there. 

328161
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a danger to society and must be taken down. 

328162
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 is a danger to society and must be taken down. 

328163
NAME
He has just been seen in %Z0v1. This is our chance. 

328164
NAME
We want you to track him down, destroy his ship and pick up his %L0v1. 

328165
NAME
Then, return to %B so he can face justice. 

328166
NAME
We’ve just received information regarding the criminal %s0 %s1. 

328167
NAME
We now understand that he is en route to a new destination, carrying %L0v2. 

328168
NAME
This is the moment we’ve been waiting for. This should send a message straight to %F0v1. 

328169
NAME
This is the moment we’ve been waiting for. This should send a message straight to %F0v1. 

328170
NAME
We want you to find him, eliminate him and pick up %L0v3. 

328171
NAME
We are told that %F0v1 has brought in a specialist for something big. 

328172
NAME
We are told that %F0v1 have brought in a specialist for something big. 

328173
NAME
%s0 %s1 is his name and he’s supposed to be good — very good. 

328174
NAME
His target was %L0v2, which he has now already acquired. We think that if we act fast, we can stop him from turning over the goods. 

328175
NAME
We want you to find him and destroy every trace of %L0v3. 

328176
NAME
%s0 %s1, a long-time thorn in our side, has just been seen. 

328177
NAME
He is headed into %Z0v1, the perfect place to disappear. We want you to help him do so, by finding and killing him before he resurfaces somewhere else. 

328178
NAME
We want %F0v1 to suspect that we did it, but we don’t want them to have any physical proof. Take every precaution. 

328179
NAME
We want %F0v1 to suspect that we did it, but we don’t want them to have any physical proof. Take every precaution. 

328180
NAME
Of course, it is entirely possible that %I0v1 may also be at work in the area too, so be very careful. 

328181
NAME
A group of %F0v2 ships appears to have been causing a lot of hassle lately. 

328182
NAME
A group of %F0v2 ships appears to have been causing a lot of hassle lately. 

328183
NAME
We want you to head to %Z0v1 and put a stop to them — permanently. 

328184
NAME
There may also be %I0v1 out there too, so take extra precautions. 

328185
NAME
To help you, we’ve sent out a few of our ships to prepare for your arrival. 

328186
NAME
Once you get out there, a group of %F0v2 ships will arrive to back you up. 

328187
NAME
Even though our ships will join you in %Z0v1, you’ll be without backup and totally alone until they arrive, so be careful. 

328188
NAME
Well, %F0v1 has crossed the line now. 

328189
NAME
Well, %F0v1 have crossed the line now. 

328190
NAME
We’ve just ID’d %I0v1 and %I1v1 of theirs. They are not in a good place. 

328191
NAME
You’re to go at once to %Z0v1 and terminate that operation post haste. 

328192
NAME
The underground says %F0v1 has nearly finished building a new installation. 

328193
NAME
The underground says %F0v1 have nearly finished building a new installation. 

328194
NAME
We didn’t know what it was at first, but now all evidence points to it being %I0v1. 

328195
NAME
You are to go to %Z0v1 and prevent this from happening. 

328196
NAME
We believe %F0v1 is trying to increase its presence. 

328197
NAME
We believe %F0v1 are trying to increase their presence. 

328198
NAME
Fly to %Z0v1 at once and destroy their new installation. 

328199
NAME
Take out %I0v2, but leave %I1v2 as a monument to their failure. 

328200
NAME
It appears a new installation belonging to %F0v1 has just been identified. Well, it’s at least part of an installation anyway. 

328201
NAME
It appears a new installation belonging to %F0v1 has been identified. Well, at least it’s part of an installation anyway. 

328202
NAME
Though it may only be %I0v1, that’s enough to cause us concern. 

328203
NAME
In any case, we will pay you %d0 credits to eliminate this problem for us. Make it go away. 

328204
NAME
You should fly to %Z0v1 at once and get to work as soon as possible. 

328205
NAME
Just to be sure, we do want you to kill all %F0v2 ships you encounter. 

328206
NAME
Our deal covers this kill and this kill alone. Any other fighting you do, you are doing for free. 

328207
NAME
We’ve noticed an unusual ebb in %F0v2 ships around your intended target. Excellent. That will work in your favor. 

328208
NAME
Rendezvous with our ships in %Z0v1. They will act as your support and help you complete your mission. 

328209
NAME
Once you have engaged %F0v1, a group of our ships will arrive to assist you in mopping up. 

328210
NAME
You’ll have no backup on this mission. Remember, you will be operating on your own, so be careful. 

328211
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has finally been betrayed! 

328212
NAME
%s0 %s1 of %F0v1 has finally been betrayed! 

328213
NAME
We now know, thanks to one of his associates, that he’s traveling in %Z0v1 at this moment. 

328214
NAME
We want you to track him down, destroy his ship, and pick up his %L0v1. 

328215
NAME
That way when you report back to %B, we can administer our own brand of justice. 

328216
NAME
It looks like %F0v1 just blew it. 

328217
NAME
It looks like %F0v1 just blew it. 

328218
NAME
Seems that one of their guys, %s0 %s1, has just been seen boarding a ship to shift %L0v2. 

328219
NAME
He’s on his way into %Z0v1, we are told. This is a great opportunity for us to act. 

328220
NAME
We want you to find him, knock him off and scoop up %L0v3. 

328221
NAME
It looks like %F0v1 has just stuck its nose in too deep. Now it’ll get cut off. 

328222
NAME
It looks like %F0v1 have just stuck their nose in too deep. Now it’ll get cut off. 

328223
NAME
Apparently, they’ve somehow managed to get their hands on %L0v2. 

328224
NAME
Or rather, they were %s0 %s1’s hands. 

328225
NAME
In response to this, we want you to find and then kill him. Also destroy %L0v3 on the spot. We can’t afford to let that kind of cargo just float around. 

328226
NAME
%F0v3 has been a great source of pain for us recently. 

328227
NAME
%F0v3 have been a great source of pain for us recently. 

328228
NAME
We’ve managed to identify and isolate the whereabouts of their leader, %s0 %s1. 

328229
NAME
Apparently, he is in %Z0v1. That’s a lucky break for us, and one we won’t waste. 

328230
NAME
Your mission is to fly out there and give him a message from %F0v1 — a final message. 

328231
NAME
Your mission is to fly out there and give him a message from %F0v1 — a final message. 

328232
NAME
Bear in mind that there is every possibility that %I0v1 may be at work there too. Watch yourself. 

328233
NAME
Word has it from %Z0v1 that there is an undesirable presence there now. 

328234
NAME
This time it’s %F0v1. We need a cleaner out there to fix this problem and we need him fast. 

328235
NAME
This time it’s %F0v1. We need a cleaner out there to fix this problem and we need him fast. 

328236
NAME
However, be careful. There may also be %I0v1 operating out there as well. Just be cautious and you should be alright. 

328237
NAME
Meanwhile, we’ve already sent out some units to act as your support on this mission. They’ll help you out. 

328238
NAME
So once you’re out there, a group of our ships will meet up with you and serve as your cover. They’ll help you out. 

328239
NAME
You might need some help out there. However, until we have another wing free, you’ll be acting on your own. Basically, you’re solo on this one, so take it easy. Do your job and do it right.

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I heard a bizarre rumor about Bretonia. They say some sort of unmarked “mystery ships” were responsible for taking out a transport loaded with confiscated Artifacts near Leeds. Bretonia intelligence is working on identifying them, but they seem to think they might have been from Rheinland.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>My brother just returned from a trading run in Liberty, and he says things are worse than we’d thought — the President is trying to maintain power over the colony, while it appears several heads of state and their military units are dissenting and openly challenging her.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Look, you didn’t hear this from me, but I think the Chancellor has gone mad. He’s openly attacking members of his own family, questioning their loyalty, and attempting to root out a traitor who none of us believe really exists.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>You know, it wasn’t always this way … something’s happened to us. Rheinland used to be a noble place — full of culture and heritage. Now, it seems like all you hear about is war and violence. If I were you, I’d leave here as quickly as you can.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>I’ve heard that Liberty has developed bombs that can turn a planet molten in a matter of minutes. They’ve been doing all sorts of illegal weapons research in that Zone 21 place of theirs. The Chancellor says they intend to use these weapons against us — they’re no better than The Order. We’ve got to stop them … Kill them before they can kill us, right?</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>

<RDL><PUSH/><TEXT>Liberty is in the hands of the navy, Bretonia is in disarray, the Rheinland Chancellor has gone mad, and now Kusari is warming up the nukes. This has been the Nomads’ plan from day one — full-scale war in the colonies. And now it looks like it’s going to happen. If all that firepower is unleashed, I don’t know if there’ll be anyone left standing — even if we beat the Nomads.</TEXT><PARA/><POP/></RDL>
